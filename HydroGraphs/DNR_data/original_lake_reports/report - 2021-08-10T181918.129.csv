07/16/2018,Beautiful day very little wind full sun. Baby Loon was born on the lake a couple days ago. Lilly pads and bogs seem to be taking over the lagoon area more and more. Not sure if this is a good thing?
08/26/2018,Very cloudy definitely effected sechi reading of 12 ft. saw 2 loons- mother and baby. Also saw Godzilla the snapping turtle- He is about 18 in long and 12 in wide on the shell. Have been seeing a lot of red headed woodpeckers and saw 2    Pileated woodpeckers all weekend.

07/08/2019,I did a secchi test on 7/3 to see if their would be any change after the busy 4th of July weekend. Both readings were 13 ft. I guess not surprising being a no wake lake. Saw a Bale Eagle on 7/3/19 flying over the North corner of the lake.
07/29/2019,A lot of clean up going on around the lake after the wind storm on 7/19/19. Many trees down around the lake but does not look like any fell into the water along the shoreline. Starting to see Algae blooms in the lake along the shoreline.
