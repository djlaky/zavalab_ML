05/25/2014,Sunny day with mild waves. At sunrise the lake was dead calm and a line of large clumps of leaves were over the weed beds off the south shoreline in Gravelly Bay. Assisted by Steve Scheible.
06/04/2014,Sunny day; winds @ 3 MPH East/Northeast and slight ripple on the water. Loons calling; five fishing boats; and four kayaks.
Anchored in fishing boat on mud bottom in Deep Hole. Made visual notations of location off Buckhorn Point.

06/17/2014,74 degrees under clear/sunny skies. Winds NW @ 10 MPH. Steady chop on water. Strong winds at midnight last night and high volume of pine dust on southern shorelines. Five canoes off Buckhorn and one kayak. Heard eagles and observed a pair of loons. Assisted by Steve Scheible
06/23/2014,77 degrees- winds S @ 6 MPH; humid. Cloudy skies and mild chop on water. Many eagles present--young and mature. Pontoons on water and three fishing boats in North Bay. Took water samples (phosphorus and chlorophyll) and mailed to DNR. Assisted by Steve Scheible.
06/26/2014,65 degrees- winds SE @ 3 MPH- partly cloudy. Four fishing boats on sand bar between island and Buckhorn--two boats in Lucia Bay; two in North Bay. Noticed one seagull! (Too early.) Four eagles in trees around Buckhorn.
Beginning Monday- June 23rd this week the lake appears to have "flipped." Algae is prevalent in all areas. In weeks previous there has been a large volume of pine dust on the water. Seems to be uncharacteristic of water in June- when typically it has been very clear. 
Assisted by Steve Scheible
07/12/2014,A cloudy morning turned quickly to partly cloudy; 72 degrees with NWN winds @ 3MPH. Slight chop on the water. Observed a single loon; eagles squeaking/calling over Buckhorn Point; one seagull; and one heron. Many fishing boats--four on the sand bar and three or more in North Bay. Water level has gradually gone back to the normal range. Sand on shoreline apparent now again.
Assisted by Steve Scheible.
07/24/2014,Partly cloudy; 74 degrees with SW winds @ 3MPH. Slight ripples on the water. Observed an eagle over Buckhorn Point. Fishing boats on the move--five in North Bay. A few boats pulling tubers. Two nights ago the temperatures hit 90 degrees.
Assisted by Steve Scheible.
08/09/2014,Absolutely picture perfect day pertaining to weather.  72 degrees and calm (no wind) and water was calm.  Ideal for Secchi reading! With calm wathers we immediately noticed debris on the surface of the lake which was littered with snails- grasslike weeds and pollen. Observed a single loon and multiple seagulls; eagles along Buckhorn Point. Seven fishing boats in North Bay and none on the Sand Bar. Stopped and spoke with Mike Kurek--long-time resident and avid fisherman. He had not yet observed the snails that we had noticed- but stated that his nephew and another long-time resident had observed an unusually high number of snakes in the water this year. We have not made that observation- but we have not been fishing in North Bay- just on our pier located on the south shoreline of Gravelly Bay.
Assisted by Steve Scheible and accompanied by our three-year old granddaughter- Payton Scheible.
08/25/2014,Partly cloudy day with SW winds @ 7MPH. Within ten minutes the clouds dissipated. Water was wavy/choppy. Noticed two fishing boats in North Bay and another moving from North Bay to Buckhorn shoreline. Noticed two other fishing boats coming in from launches in Milky Bay.  Heard eagles along Buckhorn.
Water has been noticeably brown this past week and wondering if it is from iron. Cannot see feet when standing in water by our pier- as the water is murky. To-date we have not observed the 'typical' algae bloom that we expect in mid-to-late August.
Collected the last of the three water samples for the season. Received .5" of rain last night with an abundance of lightning.
Assisted by Steve Scheible
09/23/2014,Sunny and beautiful autumn day--66 degrees with SSW winds @ 6 MPH. Attempted to take readings yesterday- but the winds kept us from holding the anchors and our temperature readings were not accurate. Three fishing boats in the area and many seagulls and a few geese.
Assisted by Steve Scheible
10/07/2014,Partly sunny with clouds to the north. 42 degrees with winds out of the W @ 8MPH. One fishing boat in Gravelly Bay. Colors are past peak and dull- but beautiful. Watched for a few minutes as four eagles were attacking a swarm of mud hens. The eagles did not appear to be successful. Saw a large loon off Buckhorn Point and plummage was gray. Winds picked up and made the temperature readings difficult as the anchors gave way. Very cold these past few days and forecast for more of the same.

The Secchi disk could be seen past the maximum length of the measuring device- which is 30 feet. Since 2013- we have never been over 20 feet of visibility! Beautiful sunny day after a week of rain. Received over 5 inches of rain the past 5 days. Musky season opening day. Many fishing boats on the water--the 43 Annual Deaf Fishing Contest on the lake this weekend. Could see at least five boats fishing in North Bay. Eagles flying over the lake near Mielke Bay. A pair of loons by Lucia and in Gravelly Bay again. We noticed a lot of debris on the water and believe that was the result of local residents breaking up the beaver dam in Lucia Bay. (Permission granted to the Big Arbor Vitae Lake Association) The recent rainfall and breaking up of the dam has caused the level of the lake to rise. 
06/17/2016,TEMP: 72 degrees; PRESSURE: 30.15; HUMIDITY: 58%; WINDS: SSW @5 MPH; WATERS: slight ripples; ASSISTED BY: Steve Scheible; OBSERVATIONS: Beautiful day under pale blue skies and many fishermen on the lake.

Partly cloudy and partly sunny skies. Two fishing boats along the Helminski shoreline; three fishing boats on the sandbar; one fishing boat off Mielke Bay; four fishing boats in North Bay and three fishing boats in Lucia. 
Many fishermen on the lake in early June- perhaps because of the pandemic. Loons have returned and at least four to five geese families.

Took water samples today for phosphorus and chlorophyll and sent to lab.
Beautiful cool morning. Rainfall continues to be above average and following a hot and humid weekend- the temperatures and humidity have dropped with cool evenings. Seagulls in Gravelly Bay; one pontoon fishing off bridge by Honeymoon Island; geese in abundance in Gravelly Bay; one fishing boat at Deep Hole pulled in a walleye as we arrived and another along Buckhorn Drive shoreline; 3 fishing boats off Sandbar; 4 fishing boats in North Bay. On return to home we passed a lone loon along the Helminski Road shoreline.

Beautiful calm and clear morning. Weeds are growing up to the surface- but not as concentrated as years past at this same point in the summer. Water clarity is low- cannot see the bottom at our pier and green in color. A few seagulls and an abundance of geese in Gravelly Bay; one pontoon cruising the lake along the west shoreline and into North Bay; one fishing boat at Deep Hole; 3 fishing boats in North Bay. Missing the loon activity on the lake this summer. Wondering if the increased jet ski traffic- along with more ski boats with big wakes are keeping them away.

Beautiful afternoon. Weeds are surfacing and more abundant- but not as thick as this same time in years past. Water is green and very murky. A few lone seagulls at random spots in Gravelly Bay; a few fishing boats in Lucia and North Bay. Mostly recreational water ski boats and tubers on the lake. 
POST NOTE: 8-26-2020 officials closed the launch and beaches at North Bay and posted lake closure notices at the public boat launches in North Bay and Mielke Bay due to an outbreak of blue/green algae and E. Coli.

ASSISTED BY: Pam Scheible. NOTE: Gary Bailey was doing the Secchi and water temperatures for the first time since he has now volunteered to be the CLMN representative for the Big Arbor Vitae Lake Association- replacing Pam and Steve Scheible. Gary performed the readings and was well-versed in the procedure. 
Beautiful fall morning. Sea gulls are still present and saw one lone loon at the Deep Hole. Four fishermen in North Bay; two on the sandbar; and one in Lucia Bay. Returning to the Bailey pier we saw an eagle along the west shoreline.
