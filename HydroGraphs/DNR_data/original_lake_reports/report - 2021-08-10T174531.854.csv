09/03/2015,Very hot and humid. Air temp comes from a phone app and I don't believe it was correct- but then the humidity may have been making it feel so hot. B-G algae bloom at boat launch. Stopped in the park office and let staff know they may want to check the beach and boat launch there. They said water level was 8" to 1' high due to having stop loss logs in place on the dam as they prepared for other dam repairs. Sky clear- air temp 82 F- wind 7mph. To find deepest point- we had to move well off from GPS point- closer to the dam and berm.

08/17/2016,Becky joined Tim for his regular date of monitoring to collect LTT samples including nitrogen series. She didn't bring the DO meter (probably thought he had one and ours wasn't needed)- so just temp data. Data collected at 13.4 feet. Lake level listed as high (visual assessment). Rebecca Williams and Alison Kuhne listed on SWF monitoring sheet. SWF sediment sample collected via Ekman dredge. 5 aliquots examined. Sample consisted mostly of inorganic material - clay and sand.
