07/20/2011,clear sky no clouds- .10 " of rain last night 85 degrees and muggy
07/28/2011,.25 " of rain yesterday- no rain since last reading.82 degrees and muggy. some light algea beads on surface. I believe this is because of lack of rain.
08/04/2011,clear sky- 2.00 inches of rain since last reading 72 degrees. Secchi dish did not hit bottom before sight gone for first time. It was half of a foot off of the bottom.
08/11/2011,68 degrees no clouds- bright sun. very little rain since last reading. 9.0 feet of water at site.
08/20/2011,Mostly sunny 70 degrees. 1/2" of rain yesterday. 10' of water at test site. One dead bullhead floating on the surface.
08/28/2011,bright sun- no clouds. calm- no wind. 1/4" of rain since last reading clear skies- no clouds. calm- no wind. 1/4" of rain since last reading. 10.25' of water.
09/05/2011,62 degrees- little wind- 1/2" of rain since last reading. 10.25 feet of water at site. water color is getting closer to blue with little rain.
09/14/2011,cool- 50 degrees. few clouds. no rain since last reading. borrowed DO and temp meter for additional data. 
09/22/2011,cloudy no sun. 1/2" of rain yesterday 10' of water at test site
09/30/2011,50 degrees. intermitent rain. 1 " of rain since last reading. Cloud and sun. Had Sandra Wickman from the DNR here to do DO and PH readings as well as conductivity. Thanks. It appears that the abuntant plant life is starting to decompose as Do has gone down from 2 weeks ago.
10/14/2011,I tried to to do secchi reading on 10/07/2011- but with 35 MPH winds- I could not hold the boat. Today is mostly cloudy- temp 48 degrees and NW winds. 2" of rain yesterday.
03/22/2012,First reading of year. Ice off on March 20- 2012. Earliest ever in 60 years.
61 degrees- intermitient sun
04/03/2012,1/2" of rain on the 2nd. Sunny out . 55 degrees
05/04/2012,Hazy sun- 68 degrees 1" of rain on the 3rd. water level a little above normal. hazy sun- 68 degrees 1 inch of rain on 3rd lake level up a little above normal.10.25'  of water at test sight
05/19/2012,sunny- 80 degrees- and very windy 10' of water at test site
05/26/2012,cloudy with hazy sun- 66 degrees. light wind. Since last reading we have had 1" of rain and 2 days of extremely high winds up to 50mph. 10' of water at test site.
06/03/2012,3 1/2 inches of rain at one time since last reading. 68 degrees- sunny- light wind. Some pine pollen on surface of water. 10.75 feet of water at test sight.
06/11/2012,72 degrees- sunny with wind. Have had strong winds for three days. 10.5 feet of water at site.
06/19/2012,78 degrees- humid- hazy sun. Had 0.3 inch of rain early this morning with 1.25" yesterday. Strong thunderstorms the last 2 days. We have seen 2 loon chicks so far this year. If the eagles leave them alone- maybe we can fledge both of them this year.
06/27/2012,hazy sunshine 72 degrees. we have had 3" of rain since last reading. water level just slightly up from normal. still have 2 loon chicks and others have told me that we have 32 pair of loons and the other pair has one chick. I haven't seen this yet. it seems odd that we would have 2 nesting pairs on a 300 acre lake. we never ahve before.
07/05/2012,sunny-85 degrees. 11 feet of water at lest site. Has been extremely hot this week with highs in the 90's and high humidity. Some weeds blown into shore line areas from heavier boat traffic cuttting them off. No invasives- but weeds all the same.
07/14/2012,82 degrees- sunny and humid. Some algea is appearing near shore with this hot weather and little breeze or rain.Loon chicks are getting bigger and should survive the eagle attacks.
07/22/2012,85 degrees.sunny. Weeds floating in lake. Lake appears to be down about 4-6".
07/30/2012,sunny 83 degrees. we had 4.5" of rain in one day since last reading. Still some weeds blowing in from boat traffic.
08/15/2012,I missed last week and found quite a change.
08/22/2012,82 degrees- sunny with light wind from the sounthwest. Very little rain as of late.
