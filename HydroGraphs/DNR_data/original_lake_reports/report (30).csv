06/28/2005,baby loon died    
05/18/2006,loons nested on island this year
05/28/2006,baby loon agg was gone from nest. I think an animl destroyed it. No baby again this year.
06/22/2007,June 9- two baby loons were born
Nested on small island
End of July one was missing- one survived

08/10/2007,Noticed three beavers throughout the month of August playing in the water. I have not seen this in the last six years.
08/27/2007,It rained for 8 days. Finally got out and noticed that the lake was an awful thick pea-green color. Took the clarity test and it was 7 ft. I have never seen the clarity of the lake at this depth. I talked to a couple that have been on the lake for 29 years- they have never seen the lake this green before.
09/15/2007,Sunny- light breeze- cool (under 50 degrees)- no boats on lake- lake very green- did not see the loons- milfoil was treated early August 2007- Dave Blumer of DNA and Mike Stachowiak assisted.
09/25/2007,On October 6 my husband and son were out on our pontoon and they watched 3 beavers for a couple hours and noticed them chewing on trees and they were dropping in the water and the beavers took the branches and brought them down the lake to build their yearly dam on the NW corner of the lake.
