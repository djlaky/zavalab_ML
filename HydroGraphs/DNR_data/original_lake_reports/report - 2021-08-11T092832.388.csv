Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
07/18/1984,Migrated from EPA STORET Legacy Database- originally reported by Wisconsin DNR    
06/24/2018,Light wind caused ripple on surface- making it difficult to get a good secchi reading.  
Final reading was probably 1-2 feet less than it would have been with calm water conditions.
05/02/2019,Water temp was same (41.3) from top to bottom
06/14/2020,Sunny + hot- 90 degrees air temp- light wind from SW Sunny and warm- surface water temp was 78 degrees- light wind from the south- partial overcast
