Subject: Temporary Algal Bloom 

Hi Joe-
As you know- Spencer and Stratton Lakes both experienced a prolonged low level algal bloom this summer. I sent samples to Madison and the following was found: 
"Species of small coccoid colonial blue-green algae were common in both samples. Another colonial blue-green- Cyanodictyon planktonicum- was quite common in the Spencer Lake sample. Cyanodictyon is capable of forming blooms- but to the best of my knowledge it is not known to produce toxins. The small coccoid blue-green algae were a mix of species and did not include the toxin-producing taxa which we are most concerned about in Wisconsin (Anabaena- Aphanizomenon- Microcystis- Cylindrospermopsis)."
I think that we had enough runoff / nutrients along with other environmental factors to cause this temporary problem. I doubt this condition will persist into next summer. Please contact me if you have questions. Thanks- Ted
