08/23/2020,It is a warm and sunny Sunday afternoon.  Boat traffic is moderate but personal watercraft (jet ski) traffic is constant.  I had one pwc doing circles and creating massive waves within 200 feet of my boat.  Its waves rocked my boat so much that it knocked my sampling reagents and glassware off the top of my cooler and onto the floor of my boat.  And at another time I had a motor boat come within about 40 feet of me creating a significant wake.  I spoke in a normal voice to the operator: "You are too close-" which he ignored.

Weather is 77 F- wind NW 3 mph- mostly sunny.  I saw no loons today- nor any other wildlife.
