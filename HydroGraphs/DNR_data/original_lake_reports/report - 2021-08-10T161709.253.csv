I suspect some inversion is starting.  Cloudy day.  Breeze 5 to 8 mph.  No boat traffic.  One juvenile loon.  This will be the last entry for the year.  Lake seems to be clear on the surface but murkier deeper.  I suspect some inversion is starting.
05/12/2018,First testing for 2018.  Ice out on May 2- possibly the latest date for the occurrence.  Bright sunny day.  No wind.  No boat traffic.  Two loons returned to the lake on May 5th.
06/08/2018,Overcast day. Winds 15 mph. No boat traffic.
07/07/2018,Bright sunny day.  No clouds.  Wind around 15 mph- gusting to 20 mph.  Considerable boat traffic.  No loons.
08/11/2018,Nice day with hazy clouds.  Wind around 4 to 5 mph.  No boat traffic.  8 loons on the lake in one big group.
10/12/2018,Cold crisp day with clear sky and winds around 10 mph.  No boat traffic.  Loons left in early September.  This will be the last entry for Viola Lake for 2018.  Surface temperature is 51 F.
05/05/2019,Ice out on April 20th.  First entry for the year.  Mostly cloudy with slight breeze of 5 mph.  No boat traffic.  No loons seen today- but have seen two on the lake this week.
05/30/2019,Clear sky and not a breath of wind.  The lake looked like glass.  No boat traffic.  The cottonwood trees were leaving a lot of their cotton on the surface.  No loons seen.  
06/15/2019,Partly sunny day with wind around 8 to 10 mph.  The lake around the shore has a lot of yellow pine pollen on it making it look murky- but the quality is still quite good.  No boat traffic.  No loons seen while testing.  The lake is starting to thermocline between 15 and 20 feet- with about an 8  F degree differential.  As the lake warms up- the differential will grow substantially with anything below the thermocline not getting above 60 F.  Dissolved oxygen is uniform at saturation down to 15 feet.  At 20 feet the D.O. increases by about 1 ppm because of the temperature change.  At the bottom- D.O. is only 2.3 ppm.
06/29/2019,Bright sunny day- wispy clouds breeze 2-3 mph.  A lot of boat traffic.  Two loons on northeast side close to shore.
07/07/2019,Sunny- clear day.  No wind. There is boat traffic.  Two loons in the area.
08/17/2019,Bright sunny day with almost no clouds.  Wind around 10 mph.  Considerable boat traffic.  No loons to be seen while testing.
09/02/2019,Clear day.  No wind.  No boat traffic.  No loons to be seen.
10/03/2019,Cloudy day.  Light breeze.  One juvenile loon on the lake.  No boat traffic.
10/18/2019,Bright sunny day with wispy clouds.  Strong wind out of the south- maybe 15 mph.  Loons are gone.  No boat traffic.  Looked for freshwater jellyfish but did not see any. This will be the last entry for 2019.
04/11/2020,First day of testing in 2020.  Ice out on the lake on April 3rd.  Sunny day with breeze about 5 to 7 mph.  One loon on the lake.  No boat traffic.
05/20/2020,Bright sunny day.  Wind around 10 mph.  No boat traffic.  No loons to be seen.
06/27/2020,Clear blue sky.  Warm day with very light breeze.  Several boats on the lake.
07/17/2020,Bright beautiful morning with clear sky and light breeze less than 5 mph.  Almost no boat traffic.  No loons in the area.
08/13/2020,Mostly cloudy with a few patches of sun.  Wind 5-7 mph with gusts up to 10 mph.  No boat traffic.  Two loons in the area.
09/17/2020,Sunny clear day with light breeze under 5 mph.  No boat traffic.  The loons have apparently gone for the season.  The freshwater jellyfish have arrived and are in the west end suspended over the deep water.  They can be seen about 2 feet under the surface- about the size of a dime in diameter.
10/07/2020,Sunny day with small puffy clouds.  The wind is out of the northwest around 10 mph gusting to 15 mph.  No boat traffic.  One juvenile loon stayed close to the boat all during the testing.  The lake is almost completely uniform in temperature from top to bottom only differing by 1.9 degrees.  Likewise- the  dissolved oxygen is at saturation from top to bogttgom except at 35 feet it drops slightly by 1.5 ppm.  The Secchi reading is also low- so I believe the lake has already gone through its Fall turnover.
