Canadian goose population in Boston Bay and Stumps Bay is significantly down do to a successful 2018 eradication program executed by the Village of Balsam Lake and the Balsam Lake Protection and Rehab district.  Observed one single mature- one young pair with no goslings- one young pair with three healthy goslings.  Bald Eagle sightings appear to be down.  Two young loons sighted. Gold Finches- Barn Swallows- Brown Creepers- Baltimore Orioles- Scarlet Tangager- a pair of Pileated Wood Pecker- Wild Turkey- Red-Bellied Wood Pecker- Mink and a Bull Snake. 
06/15/2019,Lake level is still relatively high.  Goose population is down by 50%- an acceptable level.  Two tundra swans nesting in Stumps Bay as are a pair of Sandhill Cranes.  It is enjoyable to hear their calls.

Today was clear skies- temp in the low 70's- wind from the East. Water is a little cool but several water skiers and wake boarders.   

06/25/2019,Clear blue sky- winds out of the West at 10 - 15 mph.  Ambient temp 70.5 degrees Fahrenheit.  Working with Andy Wilhoit.  Grab samples were taken per procedure for phosphorus and Chlorophyll at both sites on Balsam- site 493056 and 493058.  Samples were sent to state lab for analysis.

08/25/2020,Ambient air temp 87.0 degrees Fahrenheit; Winds ESE at 12 mph; barometric pressure 29.95 in Hg; cloud cover at about 55% - 60%. Light pleasure boating use- swimmers enjoying pleasant water temps to cool off.  Waterfowl includes evening vocalization of Loons- 4 a.m. vocalization of tundra swans before they leave to feeding locations. Have seen several diver ducks in Stumps Bay.  They tend to hang close to shore.  Canadian geese are absent the lake as nuisance control measures have had an impact.  I observed one goose today and have seldom heard any early morning vocalizations.
