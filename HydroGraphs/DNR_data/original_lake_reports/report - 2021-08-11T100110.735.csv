08/11/2001,Partly sunny- mild.  Couple of fishermen out.  Dead raccoon under boat!    
09/01/2001,Bald eagle circling.  Another perched.  Screeching some.  Sunny- light breeze.  Jet skier on lake.  Much less milfoil than normal.    
11/17/2001,Clear and very warm (about 60 F).  Few fishermen in small boats.  Light breeze.  Beautiful.

07/20/2010,90% cloud cover no wind.  Difficult to navigate through all of milfoil- possibly variable leaf milfoil.

YSI professional meter used.]
Sample depth 0-2 m integrated.
200 mls filtered for chla
08/16/2010,Max depth found was 7'.  Lots of milfoil/coontail- extremely dificult to navigate.  Winds out of ESE at 15 mph.  Integrated sample 0-2m- 200mls filtered for chla.  Hydrolab quanta used for profile.  
09/13/2010,North winds at 10-15 mph.  Integrated smaple 0-2m.  Difficult to maintain position due to wind.  Pulled up a large amount of coontail with the anchor.  Difficult to tell if secchi hit bottom due to coontail and drift.
05/02/2011,Windy and cold.  Lots of coontail on anchor.  100% cloud cover- beautiful day for December!
07/25/2011,Dock is under water- most of lake has milfoil topping out.  Landing is in disrepair and needs attention.  wind 5-8 mph.
08/11/2011,Cloudy- calm and hot.  Lots of EWM- coontail and elodea.  Site depth was 11ft.
09/02/2011,Bad storm from Point to GB.  Had to wait the storm out at the boat landing for nearly 2 hours.
07/18/2012,Abundant EWM on entire lakeshore

Bottom 1.5 - 2 feet of sampling site covered in solid coontail and elodea

Rake fullness:   3 - Coontail
                          1 - Elodea
07/31/2012,Secchi disk disappeared in aquatic plants at 5'.  Entire lake bottom is covered with coontail- elodea and EWM.
09/06/2012,Entire lake is covered with aquatic plants (EWM- Coontail- Elodea).  Secchi was lost in plants so an accurate measurement was tough to obtain.
08/12/2013,Solid aquatic plants on the whole lake.  Bottom two profile data sets were in among aquatic plants.
09/09/2013,Entire lake is solid aquatic plants. Coontail- EWM- Elodea.
05/14/2014,D.O. meter malfunctioned.  No D.O. readings were reliable
07/15/2014,Abundant plants throughout lake.  Profile at 2 m was taken among dense vegetation.
08/19/2014,Dense vegetation at sampling site.  At 2 meters down in the profile the YSI probe was among dense plants.
09/03/2014,Secchi disk hit dense vegetation before it was out of sight.  Also 2 meters down in the profile YSI probe was among dense vegetation.
07/22/2015,Plants cover the bottom of the lake. Secchi and YSI probe both hit plants
09/01/2015,secchi disk and YSI probe hit plants before hitting the bottom
05/09/2016,nuisance aquatic plant growth
