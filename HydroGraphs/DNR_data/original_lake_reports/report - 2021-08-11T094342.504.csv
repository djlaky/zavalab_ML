04/10/2010,Not as windy as the other lakes. It was easier to see the disc which is probably why the reading is a little deeper. Temperature was 66F- sunny and moderate wind.
05/19/2010,Light wind- calm water with some chop due to boats.
06/10/2010,Overcast- calm water- little wind
06/24/2010,sunny- calm- light wind- definite algae bloom
07/09/2010,Definite algae bloom. Lake was very busy all week- so the water has been choppy every day. The daytime temperature was in the upper 80's with a gentle breeze.
07/26/2010,Had problems with the HACH meter. The screen fogged up and we couldn't read the temperatures. I was able to correct the problem by warming the meter and drying it out. 
08/12/2010,Lost of boat traffic. A wake boat nearly launched me out of my 16' Alumacraft. Sunny with scattered clouds. Lots of chop and chunks of weeds floating in the area of testing. I noticed two large chunks of bog floating in the lake - one on each side of Middle Lake approxinately 1/2 way between the Landing and the channels to Mill/Green Lakes.
08/26/2010,Sunny. No Wind. Light boat traffic.
