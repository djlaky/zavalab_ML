08/29/2001,Lots of surface green scum - water green.    
09/30/2001,More weeds than in 3 years.  More surface algae.    
10/16/2001,Gave up trying to keep weeds away from dock.    
04/18/2002,strong wind most of night- april 16th- next morning
all ice gone ice out 4/16

    
05/29/2002,green scum near shore noticeable already

    
06/10/2002,nice sunny day.  Low humidity.  Lots of scum near shore.    
06/26/2002,Lots of weeds for this early    
07/03/2002,very hot and muggy for the past week.  Clear- sunny- hot again today.  2/3 inch of rain last night.    
07/09/2002,Very hot- muggy days for the past week.  So many weeds in our bay; green scum floating on the water.

08/31/2002,Lots of rain    
09/04/2002,Very Green    
09/24/2002,It has been rainy and cold.   Lots of green algae in
the water but not a whole lot accumulating along the shore on top of the
water.   Weeds are better and have died down a great deal.    
09/25/2002,Water is Murky.. Expected to find it clearer  Think Turnover has begun... (Another observer found water temperatures weren't the same at all depths till Oct 18- so turnover wasn't complete at this time)    
10/18/2002,Cold-rainy-snow nite before;  weeds have subsided;
turnover looks like it has just begun.   Freeze over of the lake was early this year on November 26    
10/23/2002,Pulled our boat out for the end of the season.    
04/22/2003,Ice out was 8 days ago on April 14- after a day and
night of windy conditions.
    
05/23/2003,Curly leaf pond weed is the worst we have seen in 4
years.   It seems to be choking out everything.  We have had a spell of
cold weather which may have turned off the Bluegill spawning- but their
beds are so inundated with pond weed that am wondering if that isn't
causing a problem for the fish spawn.   The lake has already stratified
and there is almost no oxygen below 30 feet.   Have been advised that will
probably mean massive algae blooms in the weeks ahead.... this is being
submitted much later than the test.... which has come true..    
07/07/2003,This is Monday and is cloudy and overcast with light
wind.   Has been a beautiful weekend with no rain since Friday.   Lots of
Algae accumulating in the shallows weeds are tolerable.   Crinkle Leaf
pond weed is abating... the pond weed was the worst I have seen it in 4
years this spring.    
09/05/2003,Lots of algae hanging in the water making it very
cloudy....  There has been a drought for most of the month of August and
no rain yet in Sept..   The weeds have pretty much subsided making fishing
off the dock easier and less stuff to tangle motor pr    
06/29/2004,Craig Roesler and Dave Blumer used Harold Blumer's boat to test new YSI meters (63 + 55) on this lake    
08/30/2012,Secchi readings were not taken- as we do not have a Secchi disk.  My son Logan was also with us.
06/07/2018,Sunny.  Water clear
