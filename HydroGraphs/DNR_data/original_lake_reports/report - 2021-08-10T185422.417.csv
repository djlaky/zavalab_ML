07/24/2013,Clear sky.
08/08/2013,Partly cloudy.
07/09/2016,Moderate breeze- some waves- no whitecaps- mostly sunny- air temp 73 degrees F
08/15/2016,These results will probably be the most accurate I'll ever report as conditions at the time they were taken were absolutely ideal. While I did select a water color- it was actually almost colorless.
07/03/2017,Calm- only one other boat on lake.  Deep hole is in the middle of a fairly narrow channel. It's July Fourth weekend. I lucked out with a lull in boat traffic on a beautiful- sunny day.
08/01/2020,2 kn wind- clear sky
