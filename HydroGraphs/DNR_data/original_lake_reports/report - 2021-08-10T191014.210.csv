06/18/2011,Cloudy- breeze out of so.east- 2" of rain overnight into the mid-morning.  Sandy Madsen assisted with secchi test- temperature readings and water sample.  6 or 7 fishing boats on the lake.  Began thundering while testing- got more cloudy and appeared more rain on the way.  Probably affected secchi depth reading.
07/01/2011,Overcast- hot and humid- 85 degrees. Wind from SW- pushing green surface algae to North shore.  Observed one loon- and several Canada geese at the farm. No geese seen on the lake.  3 other boats on lake.  No weeds above surface.

08/16/2014,75 degrees- partly cloudy- virtually no wind- beautiful morning.  Helpers were Henry and Leo Zuckweiler
05/23/2015,
Beautiful sunny morning- 61 degrees- sw winds at 3mph.  Saw one loon- 4 Canada geese flying- 4 fishing boats.
Assisted by Grandsons Henry(6) and Leo(3yrs- 11mo.)
06/08/2015,72 degrees- mostly sunny- wind nw at 9 mph.  Observed 12 boat trailers at landing- so lots of fishing going on this morning.  
07/26/2015,Quiet morning on the lake- mostly cloudy- 73 degrees.No wildlife observations this morning. 
05/21/2016,Beautiful sunny morning- very slight wind at 3-4 mph- 66 degrees air temp.  Several fishing boats out- no Canada geese on lake yet.
06/25/2016,82 degrees- sunny very windy.  Assisted by Tim Wheeler
07/23/2016,Did not receive vial and bottle with box this time- so only did water temp.
Weather was 82 degrees- windy- overcast- storms on the way.
08/14/2016,Gorgeous morning- calm water- quiet except for one fishing boat.  Blue sky- no wind.
05/14/2017,Sunny- winds East at 11.  No other boats on the lake- probably due to it being Mother's Day.  Previous day was one of the finest ever on the lake.  A late afternoon pontoon ride(5-6 pm) saw approx. 25 boaters on the lake actively fishing- There was no wind- and the water clarity allowed us to feel as though we were on top of an aquarium- with visibility about the best I have ever witnessed. Observed bass- crappie- northern- and other assorted panfish throughout our ride around the lake.  A pair of loons graced us with their presence and singing- and we even saw an otter surface on south side of Big Butternut.  
06/17/2017,Absolutely gorgeous morning- 69 degrees- full sun- sw wind at 5-6 mph.  Observed 5 eagles hunting- a gaggle of about 25 Canada geese of varying ages- several fishing boats.  Had my two Grandsons helping with secchi disk and temp readings.   Henry and Leo Zuckweiler.

07/29/2017,Absolutely stunning morning- full sun- west breeze 5 mph.  Observed five loons swimming  in a straight line.  We have seen more loon activity this year than in the previous 30 years.  Saw 8 loons at one time a few weeks ago.  A small private plane flew by our docks at what we considered an unsafe height. If we had been at the end of our dock we could have almost reached out and touched a wing. It did not appear to have any markings- and was not a float plane.
The water clarity and visua perception this summer is outstanding for this lake- compared to years previous.  Maybe it is due to cooler nighttime temps?
08/20/2017,Beautiful morning- just a few light clouds- temp 73 wind sw 9 mph.  Feels like we are on a private lake- no other boats out that we could see.   Assisted by Grandsons Henry and Leo.  Observed an eagle diving and coming up with a large fish.  Big Butternut has been exceptionally nice this summer- probably due to cooler overnight temps?  The lake water didn't turn the usual green color until about two weeks ago- which is rare for this lake.  Normally we see a lot of floating algae and green water in early to mid-July at the latest.

05/27/2018,Absolutely gorgeous day- sunny- temps about 75.  Saw a winter loon on the lake for the first time.  Not very many Canada geese yet- keeping fingers crossed that they found other neighborhoods to reside.
Helped by Grandsons Henry and Leo.  Temperature meter is not working- so was able to do sechhi disc only.  Water quality is wonderful- like floating on top of an aquarium.

The kids names are Owen- Rylee- J.T.- Trevor- Isaac- Mia- Ellie- Emery- Lauren- and Sam.
On the south shore- their are two pontoon boats and lifts overturned from the storm of last Friday- July 19. Many trees were downed during the storm- and the sound of chainsaws around the lake is constant.  
08/09/2019,Spectacular summer day- 74 degrees- winds WNW at 6- 47% humidity.  Two pontoon boats out- fisherman trying their luck.  Lake water was green floating at north shore line earlier- but looked much better when going out to test.  Middle of lake fine for jumping into.
