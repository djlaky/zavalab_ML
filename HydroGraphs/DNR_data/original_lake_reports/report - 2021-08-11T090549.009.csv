12/06/2013,Calcium 6.3 MG/L- Magnesium 1.6 MG/L
12/25/2013,MERRY CHRISTMAS TO MY FELLOW CLMN VOLUNTEERS!!!!!!!!!!
05/20/2014,Ice-out was 05/12; Surface water temp was 48.4F. Conductivity was 32uS. Greenish cast to water due to algae bloom from spring turnover. The zooplankton are on their way!
08/10/2014,Finally- the Secchi seems to be following the historical trend of late summer. Water is a beautiful deep blue. The rapidly rising water level (two feet in one year!) seems to be the reason for our decreased Secchi as it inundates 7 drought years worth of mostly terrestrial plants causing a jump in our Chlorophyll over previous years.
10/19/2014,We are already well into fall turnover. Secchi is tanking and the water has a greenish cast to it.
10/21/2014,OAT 52F- Wind Calm- Fall turnover well underway.
04/24/2015,Ice-Out April 20........6 days earlier than the 107 year recorded average.

04/28/2015,OAT 58F- WIND 3204- SKY CLR- Conductivity 36
05/23/2015,Secchi continues poor as cold weather delays lake stratification.
06/19/2015,Aileron helped.  Our Secchi continues to improve as the lake stratifies (see Temp profile above).
06/22/2015,Late June TP and Chl sample sent in today.

08/22/2015,Thermocline moving down in this late summertime.
10/19/2015,Turnover has begun....Secchi has dropped and water has a greenish hue to it. OAT 62F- WIND 2705- Conductivity 33 umhos.
04/21/2016,Ice-out was on April 22- four days earlier than the April 26 average of our 108 years of recorded ice-out dates. Loons already on the lake yodeling!
04/27/2016,Water taking on a greenish hue and a decreasing Secchi ..... typical of pre-stratification.

04/24/2017,Ice out was April 15. Water level the highest since 2006.
05/31/2017,Water level very high. We're up 6+" since ice-out on April 15 and up over 40" (yep- 40") since 2012. Clarity has taken a hit from the inundation of so much once terrestrial frontage.
06/16/2017,Secchi has taken a big hit from this unusually high water. The water is the highest in decades having recently gone up 11" just since ice-out on April 15- 2017. Many years of exposed shoreline had grown a lot of terrestrial plant life which has now been washed back into the lake.
06/20/2017,Highest water in decades has heavily impacted our clarity. Level now up 45" since 2012 and a full foot since ice-out April 15.......its driving the dock guys crazy!
08/16/2017,Sam Nelson helped.
05/20/2018,Ice-out was May 12- 16 days after the 100 year average of April 26. Water level at modern record high with lots of flotsam in the lake.
07/16/2018,5/18/2018: TP 9.52;  6/22/2018: TP 9.23- Chl 0.781
Water level continues to be highest in decades with old trees dead around newly flooded shoreline frontage.
08/19/2018,Clarity increasing nicely. Still highest water in many decades is killing many shoreline trees- some very old.
08/22/2018,Clarity measured by Sam Nelson.
10/05/2018,Looks like turnover is getting started.
05/14/2019,Ice-out May 6- 10 days later than our 110 year average. Extremely high water.....up 54" over the last 8 years!
