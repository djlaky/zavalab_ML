Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
06/01/2008,sunny- light wind
06/25/2011,water was unusually cloudy since all the rain- and there was a layer of pine pollen on the surface.
09/14/2011,The water has been very clear this year- except for a couple of weeks when the pine pollen caused extreme cloudiness. Floating bogs on the eastern half of the Flowage seem to be shrinking in size in the last couple of years- leaving more open water- but also more shallow.
08/10/2013,Bryozoans are present attached to sticks near beaver lodges.
06/17/2017,Lots of pine pollen
07/30/2018,a little algae
