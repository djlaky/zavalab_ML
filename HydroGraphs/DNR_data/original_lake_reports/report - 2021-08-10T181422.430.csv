07/31/2008,The water quality depth from the point of the readings (I took 2 of them) was 9 ft both times.  However- because I don't think I was exactly over the "deep hole" the disk disappeared beneath the weeds before it was not possible to see it.  I hope to do more readings over the "deep hole" to try and get a more accurate reading.  

I would rate the water quality as being "green" and the enjoyment factor as a #2.  

The weather was sunny and partly cloudy.
