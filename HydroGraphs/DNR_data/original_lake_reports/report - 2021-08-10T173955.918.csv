06/09/1994,Several algal blooms in the last month    
07/15/1994,Lake has been very cloudy even in March when I put my boat in- Department of Natural Resources dam- carp are the cause- weed growth not like in the past- very sparse    
07/21/1994,Windy- occasional thunderstorms    
07/30/1994,Still silty- water cloudy- weed growth is better- boat survey taken 7/15/94- 184 power boats out anchor or docked at all times on the lake    
09/15/1994,Very windy- several large milfoil patches with above water growth    
06/01/1995,Surface algal blooms- obvious beaver activity.  Lake level is 45'- 9" higher than normal    
08/03/1995,Overcast.    
10/05/1995,Overcast- windy.    
09/10/1996,Water clearing in past 2 weeks.    
10/15/1996,Water finally cleared up nicely- this- 10 years ago was the way it always was- increased numbers of zebra mussels- especially on the rocks.    
04/28/1997,No algae blooms yet- zebra mussels can be seen in shallow water.    
06/04/1997,Slight algal bloom- zebra mussels visible on hard surfaces in shallow water.  Water visibly clearer than this time last year.    
07/15/1997,Clear water clarity from last test (6/4) - has gone south- clarity impaired by algal bloom caused by warming water with result of suspended green matter in water giving murky green appearance - increased numbers of zebra mussels noted.    
09/09/1997,Water clear - green.
