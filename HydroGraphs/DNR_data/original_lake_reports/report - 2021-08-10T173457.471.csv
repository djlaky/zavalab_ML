Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
06/30/1980,Migrated from EPA STORET Legacy Database- originally reported by Wisconsin DNR    
08/28/1994,Weather/waves: sunny- mild waves.  Readings are very impaired due to excessive weed growth.    
06/09/2005,Note:  There were 2 samples on this day at this lake.  1 in a bay near a horse farm (high total phosphorus)- and 1 at the Deep Hole site.  The lab phosphorus bottles were apparently switched around- so a correction was made to tag the higher TP reading to the Bay station ID 10030698 - per conversation with Sue Graham who talked to the volunteer and Donna Sefton 10/28/2009.
