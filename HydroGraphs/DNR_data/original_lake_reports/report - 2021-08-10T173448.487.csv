04/08/2015,Used the LRMD meter. This was also Lisa's training for CLMN.
05/27/2015,Training of new CLMN volunteer Craig Kempel.  Also assisted:Kyle Whalley- Lianna Spencer- Stephanie Hansen.  Weather was pleasant- sunny- low wind. 
06/26/2015,We collected Chlor A and phosphorus samples.  Chlor A sample in the freezer.  However- did not have acid for phosphorus.  It was overcast and calm.  
07/08/2015,Weather was cooler- partly cloudy- and a bit windy.  Water had more algal growth.  Recent weather was sunny a dar prior and rainy 2 day prior.  Samples were taken and Chlor a was frozen overnight- and phos was placed in the fridge.  Lisa Griffin assisted Craig Kempel.  Craig is the main monitor and Lisa will input data into SWIMS and offer assistance if needed.
08/07/2015,Lisa Griffin assisted with monitoring
09/01/2015,Very muggy! Cloud cover 0%. Air temp 78 F. Wind according to phone weather app-8 mph.
03/28/2016,Also assisted by Bob Volenec who took us out in his boat. We used it early on Rock Lake and decontaminated it with bleach solution. Beautiful afternoon just a little chilly. We saw three loons- including one that came within 50 feet of the boat. Readings at 47.5'
05/23/2016,Lisa Griffin assisted with Data collection.  It was a beautiful sunny day.  Areas on the east side of the lake showed algae present at the surface next to the shoreline.
06/24/2016,Lisa Griffin assisted with Collection.  Phosphorus and chlor a collected.  Phosphorus placed on ice and later put in refrigerator until sumbission to the state lab.  Chlor a sample was placed in the freezer.  Weather was beautiful and sunny.  
07/26/2016,Cloud cover 0%- Wind 2 mph- air temp 81F; Not sure why the data collectors skipped the 33 feet reading. Will update if I find out. (Jeanne Scherer)
07/26/2016,Spiny waterflea sample was collected with Ekman dredge method - 5 aliquots were examined.
08/29/2016,Lisa Griffin assisted with Monitoring.  Weather was warm and sunny.  Minnows were at the surface.
09/12/2016,Lisa and Craig who normally do CLMN monitoring for Lake Ripley helped SCR by collecting the final LTT sample for 2016. Thank you! Weather was warm and windy. Measurements are in feet because that is how their meter cable is marked for CLMN. 
03/22/2017,No pH readings. A new probe is needed. 48' at hole today
06/27/2017,Jay Settersten boat was used.  Weather sunny and clear with winds 8-10 mph. Algae mats were found below the water surface- possibly attached to plants looking like large jelly fish.  Some were 1 foot in length others were 3 feet in length.
07/17/2017,Collectors: Amanda Smith- Kevin Olson
No DO measurements due to DO meter reading negative values at depths greater than 7 ft. ?
07/31/2017,Collectors: Amanda Smith- Lisa Griffin- Craig (CLMN)- Kevin Olson
Used Lisa Griffin's DO meter
07/31/2017,In combination with Kevin Olson and Amanda Smith who conducted LLT monitoring.  No phosphorus or chl a were collected and submitted by volunteer monitors as it was done with LLT sampling.
08/14/2017,Weather was overcast during monitoring.
