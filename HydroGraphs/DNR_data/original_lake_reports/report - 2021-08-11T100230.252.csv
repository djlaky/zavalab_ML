06/24/1990,Sprayed shoreline again- more green slime.    
07/05/1990,Sprayed with diquat- weeds breaking up- clarity poor- new type weed growth- lots of slime.    
07/17/1990,Green slime in lake- clarity lousy- "I think they killed too many weeds."    
08/02/1990,Diquat for weeds- copper sulfate for algae- lake bottom like green mountains- Maybe should just cut weeds     
08/11/1990,Lake clearing some- bottom still like green mtns.- hope we didn't harm the fish.    
06/07/1991,Weedy- silt problem.    
06/13/1991,Weedy- silt problem.    
06/21/1991,Same.    
06/29/1991,Same.    
07/05/1991,Same.    
07/13/1991,Same.

06/19/1992,Cutter still broke- lots of weeds.    
06/30/1992,Cutting weeds.    
07/03/1992,Cutting weeds every day.    
06/01/1993,Weeds will be poisoned around the 10th of June.    
06/07/1993,Started cutting weeds today.    
06/14/1993,Lake was poisoned for weeds.    
06/28/1993,Poisoning was effective- weed growth at minimum because of temp and sun.    
07/09/1993,Lake color from water let in by ditch that was dug to drain a swamp- silt.    
07/11/1993,Swamp ditch still staining water- silt.    
07/22/1993,Getting drainage from 400 acres of swamp + woods because of ditch that was dug- in future 10" of drainage from 600 acre Silver + Iaogami lakes.    
08/05/1993,Drainage from Silver- Iaogami- and swamps is ruining our lake- this is a lousy situation.    
05/01/1994,Last year I could see 15' on May 3- 1993.    
05/08/1994,Last year I could see 16' on 5-21-93.    
06/07/1994,Weeds are growing + growing + growing + growing.    
06/17/1994,Weeds are growing + growing + growing + growing.    
06/22/1994,Cutting weeds again- a- algae bad- will poison soon.    
06/28/1994,Cutting weeds again.  Algae bad- will poison soon.    
07/06/1994,Weedy- cutting all the time.    
07/14/1994,Weedy- cutting all the time.    
07/22/1994,Too many weeds.  Lots of algae.  Lake looks lousy.    
08/04/1994,Too many weeds.  Lots of algae.  Lake looks lousy.    
08/11/1994,Weedy and algae.    
08/19/1994,Weedy and algae.    
08/22/1994,Diversion from Silver/Irogami Lakes is continuing- weed treatment and harvesting continuing- water quality looks fairly good- normal rain- Dennis Weisensel- Dan Helsel and Scott Szymanski on the lake today.    
08/29/1994,Weedy- "still cutting".    
09/08/1994,Way too much algae.  Lake looks bad.    
09/22/1994,Whole bottom of lake covered with algae.  Wish they would stop poisoning lake.    
09/28/1994,Beautiful day- some floating algae- bottom plants in reasonably good control- desirable plants on the increase- milfoil pretty well controlled with harvesting- water diversion still flowing from Silver/Irogami Lakes through Lake Alpine.    
10/28/1994,Overcast- windy (15-20mph) - temperature is 50 degrees- no floating algae- plants are dying down- water diversion (Department of Natural Resources permit) from Irogami and Silver Lakes barely flowing through Lake Alpine    
05/04/1995,Public perception due to coldness.  Run off from marsh is clouding lake- "Irogami".    
08/20/1995,Beautiful sunny day - temp is 80 degrees - very little floating algae  - underwater plants are healthy/ not a major problem- lake district treating for floating algae/harvesting underwater plants at 3' level (below surface).    
10/25/1995,Beautiful sunny day- temp is 57 degrees.  Wind is SW @ 10 mph- light and heavy rain in the last several days.  No floating algae- water is very clear.
