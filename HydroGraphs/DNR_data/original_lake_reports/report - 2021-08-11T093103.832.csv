08/25/2013,Sunny- SW winds 10-15 mph- no boating activity.
05/20/2014,Calm and overcast. Air temp 60.6- Water is very cloudy and a murky brown. Perhaps due to spring turnover and 1" of rain in the last 12 hours. Ice out was 5/5/2014.

06/01/2015,Water is exceptionally clear. I don't recall secci reading like this. Several owners commented it has been this way for a couple weeks. Clear sky- 67 air temp. S wind 5mph. Light surface chop. This report date is water clarity and temp only.
07/05/2015,SW wind 5mph. Surface chop. 67 Air temp. Ptly Cloudy. Two boats tubing- Two boats fishing. 
07/26/2015,Hot and sunny all day. Air temp 81.9. SW wind 5-10. Clear sky. Quiet on the lake. Only one other boat out. 
08/29/2015,Sunny and calm. 85 air temp. Several boats touring about the lake and 3 fishing boats. Water is green with some surface bloom of algae on windward side of the lake. This is the last chemistry test sent in this season. Will try to take Secci and Temp profiles into the fall. 
10/07/2015,Clear sky- calm winds. Fall colors were beautiful. No other boats out.
07/04/2016,Water a bit more murky than expected. A large amount of boat traffic may contribute. Water temp is not very stratified. Sunny- no clouds- air temp 80 degrees- mild chop on the water. 
07/24/2016,Light chop- W 11mph. Mostly cloudy. Several boats out. Water seems turbid. Very little temp stratification until  more than 10'
10/02/2016,Lake level seems low even though there has been much rain. Water color is very green an cloudy. Windward side of lake is very green. Air temp 68. Sunny. N winds 5mph- 
06/27/2017,Water has a brown tint and maybe 6" higher than normal due to significant rains. Water seems moderately clear with a brown stained appearance likely from inflow from the swampy areas. Sunny day Air temp 78. 
07/26/2017,Mostly sunny- air temp 80. winds SW at 10. Water color still a murky brown. 
09/05/2017,Cold night and strong NW winds seem to have mixed the water temp the entire depth. Partly Cloudy- 62 degrees- NW wind 15 mph. Cold night and strong NW wind seems to have mixed entire water column. 
09/26/2017,This was temp and DO only. This was the first DO reading in summer. Huddy was along. SW wind 5mph- 69 air temp.
10/05/2017,Temp and DO test done with YSI meter from Vilas Co. 56 degree air temp. NW wind 8mph. With Bob Hodkiewicz.
03/11/2018,Doing a DO Check in 12' of water in front of Hodkiewicz home. 22" of ice
06/05/2018,This is the first test this season that applies to Deep Hole location but is sent in to the lab as a MLA billed cost.
62 degrees- NNW wind 10mph- Sunny

07/06/2018,Clear sky- Calm winds- Huddy helped with his DO meter. Noticed correlation between low DO and no fish and fuzzy on graph. In two areas beginning at 12 feet.
08/14/2018,With Huddy- Clear sky- light wind SE. The transition to no O2 was higher in water column. Checked 6 locations and similar results. O2 in mg/L  6'-8.95- 7'-6.9- 8'-3.0- 9'-.2- 12'-.07
08/20/2018,This date we took a deep water sample using Van Dorn sampler. The DO level here was .02. Test was sent in to specifically measure Orthophosphates. This may give us an idea of unbound phosphorous.  This date we took a deep water sample using Van Dorn sampler. The DO level here was .02. Test was sent in to specifically measure Orthophosphates. This may give us an idea of unbound phosphorous. 
10/04/2018,Mostly clear- NE wind 10mph- 45 degrees. The lake has mixed top to bottom. DO and temp uniform. Fish showing up on bottom once again. 
06/06/2019,Calm- Clear sky- 76 degrees- Water column is exceptionally clear. EWM DASH harvested on center bar 6/5. 
This was sent in as a supplemental  report.
07/27/2019,Partly cloudy 82 degrees. 2 days of high SW winds mixed the water column and very little stratification was evident.
Water seems abnormally clear for late July. 
09/01/2019,With Huddy and Joe Huber. Compared MLA DO meter to Vilas Co calibrated meter. In table that follows MLA Unit is listed first set of data. Second set of Data is Vilas Co unit. 
Several days of high winds seemed to have mixed entire water column. 
09/02/2019,64 air temp. Mostly sunny. No stratification found. Several days of high winds have mixed entire water column. 
10/09/2019,Sunny 70 degrees. 3 days of strong SE winds have mixed the entire water column. DO / Temp data from Vilas Co. test unit.

03/10/2020,This is a DO test by Huddy and Joe Huber. MLA instrument.
06/01/2020,DO and Temp check only by Huddy and Joe Huber. Sunny. 74 air temp
06/28/2020,Mostly Sunny- Light SE wind- 88 air temp
07/27/2020,Full sun. 65 air temp- light breeze SW
09/07/2020,Air temp 58. W wind 10mph. With Bob Hodkiewicz. Big cool down and windy for the last two day seems to have remixed the entire lake top to bottom.
10/03/2020,Last water test of season. Cloudy- 45 air temp- slight breeze. With Jean Rappold
