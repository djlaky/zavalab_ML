07/01/2019,8 feet Secchi depth.  We have a loon nest they had two chicks and one is gone.?? The other baby loon is doing just great. Lake is quite high- guess about 1-1/2 feet. higher then last year.
07/08/2019,lake clear but looks green suspect because of the GREEN GRASSY bottom of the lake. My opinion is the Satillite shows it greener then it is.??? Depth of secchi is 8.5 feet
