07/03/1989,5 perception on east side.  Sunny- light wind- algae severe in some areas (east shore) - Easily raked other shores.    
07/10/1989,Perception of 5 on east shore.    
07/24/1989,Perception of 5 on east shore.  Hazy- hot- water considerably clearer than last check.  Algae tapering off.    
08/11/1989,Perception of 5 on east shore.  Hazy.  Algae seems to be abating.  Level-1" below benchmark.  Very heavy "septic" smell on east shore.    
08/24/1989,Perception of 5 on east shore.  Sunny.  Since last report had two reports of strong septic smell- east side.  Confirmed.  What can be done     
09/03/1989,Perception of 5 on east shore.  Sunny.  Starting to get a weed problem (thought to be wild celery  )    
09/15/1989,Perception of 5 on east shore. clear- sunny-suspended algae and/or sediment clearly visible.  Lots of violations and little enforcement.    
09/29/1989,Perception of 4 on east side.  Suspended particles very much in evidence- sunny weather.    
06/11/1990,Ice off-3/25/90.  Hazy to cloudy.  Severe micro cystis problem last week.  Water smells very bad.  Clarity very bad- worst in history.    
06/19/1990,Sunny- algae starting to form on bottom.    
06/29/1990,Hazy- lake is getting worse! help!    
07/10/1990,Hazy- water has cleared considerably!    
07/19/1990,Hazy.  Deterioration May be due to several power boats creating huge wakes.  We plan to do a study if funds are available to us and hopefully treat the lake in 1991.    
07/26/1990,Mostly sunny.  Water cleared considerably.  Lake seems to be cloudy but with less "green algae."    
08/07/1990,Sunny- green algae starting to form on bottom- not nearly as bad as last and other years.    
08/17/1990,Hazy.  Reduced visibility- probably due to heavy speed bat use.  Lake far to small for sure a pounding.  Green algae far less than other years.    
08/28/1990,Sunny.  Appears to be another bloom or turnover.  Lots of rain and heavy boat traffic also hurts.  Lots more weeds than ever- but not as much green algae as in some recent years.    
09/17/1990,Sunny.  Applying for a study grant.    
09/27/1990,Sunny- slightly hazy.  Had green scum on water 9/26- no dispersed by breeze.    
12/27/1990,Ice on eve of 12/25.  There was no secchi reading- just observation.  Happy new year!    
04/17/1991,Ice out 3/28. Bright and sunny.  Chunks of algae already floating around. Tile-off heavy during past 2 weeks.  Bank erosion May be a problem with high level and power boats.  Silt will be.    
04/28/1991,Sunny.  Lake is getting cloudy.  Brown instead of green.  Large chunks of algae (or sewage) floating around.  Power boats creating silt problems at shoreline.  Unbelievable-in April!  need no wake!    
05/09/1991,Slight evidence of suspended particles. sunny- slight haze.  Cannot believe change.  Some evidence of floating or suspended chunks also.  We are very interested in getting into advanced self-help- please advise how.    
05/13/1991,Clarity unbelievable!  not seen in years.  Sunny- slight haze. still evidence of suspended particles and some chunks of algae.  Some algae forming in spots.  Lots of small dead fish (100s) I think we're ready advanced self help    
05/26/1991,Sunny.  South wind.  Lots of suspended particles.  Reduced visibility might be due to motor boats and wind.  Algae is really building upon bottom as water warms.    
06/02/1991,Sunny but hazy.  Suspended particles getting worse and larger.  Algae starting to smell bad.  Lots of dead fish.    
06/13/1991,Sunny- algae is almost solid 40-50' from shore.  However- it has cleared considerably from 6/2 reading.  Impossible to fish from pier or shore.    
06/23/1991,Swimming is possible.  Sunny. NE wind has blown algae toward shore.  Weather cool- so few boats.  Water unusually clear.  Some suspended particles.    
07/02/1991,Sunny and if we didn't rake- it would be 5 algae is 40-50 solid from shore.  Smell is horrible!  however- algae does not seem to be spreading as in other years.  Water is generally clearer than in years.    
07/11/1991,Algae has been raked from most beaches and appears not to be reforming    
07/25/1991,Sunny.  Reduced depth probably due to 1.8" rain on 7/22.  Algae does not appear to be reforming.  Abundance of suspended particles.  Of 6 "event" check sites- one on south side had tremendous flow.  Others almost dry    
08/13/1991,Algae starting to come back.  Appears to be a bloom but could be due to heavy motor boat use.    
08/23/1991,Hazy sunshine-substantial suspended particles.  Algae returning    
09/04/1991,Sunny.  Reading taken one day after .8" rain    
09/21/1991,Algae is "retreating."  what I think is wild celery was a "bumper crop" this year.  It interferes with swimming and fishing.    
04/28/1992,Hazy sunshine.  Lake has algae particles floating around.  Also chunks of rotting vegetation.  Ice off on 4/8.  This is a far cry from last spring where we had 15'-17' readings.    
05/06/1992,Sunny. light breeze- brownish algae chunk and suspended particles very prevalent.  Only a few dead small fish.  Lots of silt poured in.  Hurry up "clean water act"    
05/19/1992,Sunny- hazy.  Lake has cleared considerably- suspended particles quite evident but little algae growth.  Motor boats active since ice out and creating silting during operating hours.    
06/03/1992,Sunny- algae has really bloomed in last 10 days.  Help! now that Thompson has quitted the clean water bill- how do we stop the drain tiles from polluting out lake   help.    
06/09/1992,Sunny- slight haze.  Slight improvement in last week in clarity- but algae is thriving.  What about the rye straw treatment- as for lake tides     
06/30/1992,Sunny.  Water very bad.  Green scum on surface and suspended particles.  Algae buildup has been worse.    
07/15/1992,Sunny- algae level considerably reduced.  Appears to be dying.  Smell at shoreline is terrible    
07/30/1992,Sunny- almost flat calm.  Lake has miraculously cleared.  Very little algae.  Wild celery very short.  Probably due to little rain and runoff- more holding tanks and mound systems and cool weather.    
08/11/1992,Water is cool.  Sunny.  Algae and weed growth appears behind last year    
08/22/1992,Sunny- slight haze.  Algae and weeds much lower than last year.    
05/06/1993,Chunks of algae floating all over.  Silt has been pouring in through 2 tiles- site 16e@ for weeks.    
05/22/1993,The site test 16h2 has finally stopped flowing.    
06/03/1993,Sunny- suspended particles in water- algae on shoreline    
06/10/1993,Sunny- slight haze- algae bloom    
07/07/1993,Sunny- slight haze- thick algae growing out 50'- new weed growth    
07/15/1993,Sunny- best reading this year- suspended algae seems to be declining- much greater weed growth than  1992.    
08/10/1993,Wild celery very thick- 2 cases of swimmers itch- slight haze- algae very thick- 2 patches of purple loosestrife    
08/24/1993,Sunny- windy 10-15 mph- algae appears to be dying- water celery taking over- 2 patches of purple loosestrife- 3 cases of swimmers itch    
09/01/1993,Sunny- algae slowly disappearing- little rain thus no runoff    
09/11/1993,Sunny- hazy- algae down- wild celery very thick    
09/24/1993,Sunny- algae receding.  Biggest problem is wild celery- spreading- thick.    
05/27/1994,Algae starting to bloom-slower because of cold weather.  East side of lake at e3 + e8 is solid algae.    
06/05/1994,Sunny-east side of lake choked with algae.  Report on 4-25-94 test shows extremely high nitrogen entering through tiles.    
06/12/1994,Algae not too bad except E side- sites e3 + 8 where it's solid.    
07/02/1994,Sunny- windy.  Middle of algae bloom.  Algae condition has been worse- have more holding tanks-less faulty systems.  Must stop drain tiles!    
07/10/1994,Solid green algae not bad-worst at east end drain.  Water clarity worst this year.  Could use more law enforcement!    
07/16/1994,Sunny-while lake is "cloudy"- lots of suspended particles-algae build-up is less than in past.  With wave action lake really gets dirty.  Need law enforcement for motor boats.    
07/24/1994,.9" rain on 7/23 p.m.  Sunny- boating extremely heavy creating shoreline turbulence.  Personal water craft especially bad.  Need enforcement!  (something I can't read) .    
07/31/1994,Sunny- 7/31-2"+ rain-7/31 evening.  Water cloudy- but algae not bad.  Boating pressure heavy.    
08/07/1994,Sunny.  Less algae- but lots of suspended particles.    
08/14/1994,Sunny.  Suspended sediment still prevalent.  Daily violations of no-wake laws + encroachment (within 100' of rafts + piers) creating additional sediment.    
07/09/1995,Public perception due to sediment or dirt.  Heavy rain 2 weeks ago.  Algae dropped way off.  Heavy boating pressure.  Large 1/0 craft.  Shoreline takes a beating.    
06/12/1996,Slightly cloudy- some algal.    
06/26/1996,Slightly cloudy- algae level up.    
07/06/1996,Clear day- calm- algae close to shore- 20-30 yards.    
07/13/1996,Cloudy- calm- algae close to shore 20-30 yards.    
07/21/1996,Partly cloudy- calm.    
08/02/1996,Some algal blooms- calm water- partly cloudy skies.    
08/13/1996,Cloudy overcast sky.  Water calm.    
08/23/1996,Water calm- clear skies- sunny- long string weed growth around the lake.    
09/11/1996,Partly cloudy skies- calm water.    
06/18/1997,Clear day.  Some algal bloom present.    
07/05/1997,Sunny weather.  Calm.    
07/24/1997,Clear- sunny and calm.
