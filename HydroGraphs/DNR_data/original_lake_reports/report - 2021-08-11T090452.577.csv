08/17/2017,some wave action making secchi reading difficult.
08/29/2017,Completed lake chemistry to P + Chrol. Beautiful day no wind. Also did a Secchi + lake depth temperature. All measurements done by Zarembka + Polivka
06/12/2018,partly cloudy- minor chop.
06/26/2018,Also did lake chemistry collection. Sent chemical samples from Arbor Vitae Post Office on 26JUN. Lake was too choppy to do temperature depth measurements.
07/06/2018,Calm day. Beautiful day
07/31/2018,Beautiful day- calm. Ciscos were jumping at deep hole; 3 eagles were trying to eat 'em. Fred Zarembka assisted in the lake chemistry and temp profile Fred  Zarembka + I did lake chemistry and temp profile today. Ciscos were jumping at the deep hole an 3 eagles were diving to get 'em. Beautiful day- calm.
09/06/2018,Tried to do lake temp measurements- but temp sensor started indicating abnormal readings after 20ft. Will try and determine the cause and make another attempt over the weekend.
09/16/2018,Sunny. 8 knots wind from SSW.
Measured temp down to 55 ft. Thermocouple working AOK.
05/01/2019,all data taken by Fred Zarembka on 5/1/2019. Recorded by Barry Polivka on 5/27/2019.
06/07/2019,SW wind moved boat during temp reading. Don't think the deep readings were completely accurate.
06/27/2019,ALSO DID P + chlorophyll today- will mail on Monday 01JUL19.

Lake surface loaded will pine pollen- along the shores and at deep hole (65ft).
08/22/2019,Did temp profile- Phos + Chlo. Cloudly day- low wind. Did Secchi reading also.  Performed lake chemistry and secchi reading today. Low wind and partly cloudy sky.
