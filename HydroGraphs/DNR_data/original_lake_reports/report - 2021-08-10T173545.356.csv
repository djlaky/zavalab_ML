03/28/2016,Also assisted by Bob Volenec who took us out in his boat for monitoring today. Chilly and breezy- but over all a beautiful day. Cloud cover about 35%- Air temp. 11.7 C. Wind 10-15 mph.  The water level is slightly high for this time of year- above the range for management of the dam.  Patricia checked staff gauge and will add that data in her data entry. I accidently read off the DO % saturation instead of mg/L. After getting the barometric pressure for the 1-2pm hour from Sullivan weather station staff- I was able to convert to mg/L using a USGS conversion tool. This method was not a sensitive as the probe. The original data is available.  (Jeanne)
03/28/2016,windy- partly cloudy
Jeanne recorded temp/do profile as part of long term trends
The water level reading on the gage is seasonally high - according to the DNR rules for the water level management at the dam.
