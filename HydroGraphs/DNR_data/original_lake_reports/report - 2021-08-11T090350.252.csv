06/01/2008,sunny- light wind
07/09/2010,after 2 days of rain.  2 loons spotted. surface water very warm normal weed density
08/01/2010,loons on lake/algae bloom in some locations
09/05/2010,no loons now.  5 1/2 inches of rain fell this week.  very brown
09/18/2010,heavy rains during the week again.  Still no sign of the loons.  Leaves turning
10/08/2010,poor clearity- very brown- heavy rains during the week. leaves amount gone.  Unseasonable warm today 80 degrees
05/02/2011,Very dark brown- ice left lake 10 days prior- no loons- tanic brown
05/18/2011,Dark brown- 2 loons- wasel- Great Blue Heron- caught 18" Northern- 2 eagels- Good Fishing
06/12/2011,Dark brown- slightly clearer- 5 loons sighted- otter- lost 20+ inch large mouth - see Bonnie- some weed growth
07/24/2011,Dark brown- clearest to date- 1 baby loon- baby king fisher- great swimming- quiet weekend
08/07/2011,Brown- clear- bright green floating algae- baby loon 3 times size- good fishing- beetle spines- 6 species caught
08/14/2011,Water clearest of year- quiet- baby loon fed by house- 2 eagles- great temp.- good swimming- great 4 days
07/24/2016,Wind storm knocked down trees at shoreline causing much erosion and sediment. Normally much clearer.
06/17/2017,Lots of pine pollen
07/29/2017,Very heavy green-brown algae
08/13/2017,Still some green-brown algae- but improved from two weeks ago
06/13/2018,pine pollen and either sediment or algae present
07/15/2018,Sediment or algae - really bad! Second year of abnormal murkiness. One year ago during a really bad storm- lots of shore-side trees blew shore-ward- upending all the sediment into the lake. Since then- either sediment or algae has impaired the water quality of this pretty little 37 acre lake - spring fed.
07/23/2018,calm. Algae sampling and secchi with Jim Kreitlow. Algae quite bad- with some scum on surface.
07/30/2018,Algae bad; some scum in open water; heavy scum around edges and in quiet coves; calm wind
