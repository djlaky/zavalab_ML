08/27/2019,Read during break in scattered clouds.  Moderate wind.  This is super satellite day- three passing over our path 24- so I did secchi and collected water samples as requested by Catherine Hein.  The DO meter was not available until the next day- so I did another secchi and the DO/Temp then.  So- I have some data for consecutive days.
08/28/2019,Read during break in scattered clouds. Very light wind.
I did consecutive days (8/27 and 8/28) because 8/27 was super satellite day- three passing over our path 24- so I did secchi and collected water samples as requested by Catherine Hein that day  The DO meter was not available until 8/28- so I did another secchi and the DO/Temp.
