Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
04/29/2007,With plates being attached to culverts to control level- normal appears high.
05/27/2007,Filamentous algae in west (shallow) side.  
06/10/2007,Duckweed abundant in cattails.  Could not see filamentous algae.  SAV/EV baskets installed.
08/12/2007,Lilies growing in baskets.  Much rain in last week.
04/20/2008,200 dead carp
05/25/2008,Water Level 9" below crest of culvert
08/19/2008,water level 10" below crest of culvert plate
08/28/2011,Dense duckweed among the cattails lining the shore and less dense across the pond.  Most extensive duckweed I've seen in last five years.  The chlorophyll-a sample will not reflect the duckweed since the sample was taken below the surface. 
06/17/2012,Water levels about 2 to 3 inches below top of plate on culvert.  It doesn't appear that there has been flow from the pond for some weeks.  Sago pondweed common and easy to observe in SW bay with water levels down.  
07/15/2012,Water levels very low- about 12 inches below top of plate on culverts.  No water discharged for at least a month.  0.1 inches of rain in last few days- abut very little in last four weeks.  Blue-greens abundant on north end of pond; some looking black.  
06/28/2015,Substantial floating algae and no wind likely influenced lower DO than normal. 
06/27/2016,Pickeralweed establishing and blooming
07/31/2016,The 2 foot Secchi depth is the greatest depth I've seen in five years.  This is after more than 7 inches of rain- by my rain gauge- in the last two weeks.  Apparently there was little sediment in the runoff.
07/23/2017,Lake level was as high as I've seen it in ten years.  About 10 inches of rain in the last week.  Much rain in this urban watershed tends to produce greater Secchi depth readings.
06/24/2018,7 or so days ago- 4.6 inches of rain in watershed.  Water levels returned to normal- but substantial potential to flush the pond.
07/18/2018,Worst Secchi depth in a few years; very green.  Some blue greens mixed in with duckweed along shore.  Warm and nearly 2 inches of rain last week- particularly about 1 inch per hour.
08/26/2018,Within one week of record floods.  Nearly 9 inches of rain in watershed.  Pond now at normal levels.

Much duckweed at northeast end.
05/26/2019,One of the first days of sunshine and low wind speeds.  Much of last few weeks- cool- rainy and windy; causing higher turbidity in pond.  Water levels high.
06/25/2020,Day after substantial rainfall.
07/22/2020,Lake level lower than top of plate on outlet.
08/25/2020,Water levels very low due to the lack of rain; about 9 to 12 inches from top of plates on outlet culverts.
