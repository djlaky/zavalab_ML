05/17/2015,It had rained most of the day and it  was both windy and foggy. This was the only day that I could be up to take the samples before our trip out of the country.
06/19/2015,Sunny day- Kevin and Aaron went out to collect the samples. The water level was high and flowing over the dam. We have had a lot of rain. 
pH 6.0



07/20/2015,Kevin collected the sample along with our son Aaron. It was sunny- 80F- SW winds at 5 knots. The water temp was 77F. They saw about a 9" bass.  pH 6.5
08/30/2015,Kevin + Aaron collected the samples.  It was sunny- 68F- winds from South 10 knots.
Lake sample pH 6.0.
We collected additional samples per Ashley's request. The acidified deionized (blank) water was pH 2.5. The deionized water alone was pH 5.0.

05/28/2016,Sunny 72F- Wind WSW 7 mph.
Previous days had been heavy winds so the water was stirred up some. There was some floating millfoil.
Several young ducklings with parents were spotted in the water and a kingfisher.

June 2016 3.21 ug/l
June 2015 1.67 ug/l
June 2014 2.22 ug/l
No reading June 2013 but July 2013 was 4.49 ug/l This could be due to the transportation of the tube. The tube was collected- put on ice in a cooler- and transported one hour to our main home.  It was then frozen until being sent out the next morning. Normally we collect the tube- freeze it at the cabin- and then transport it frozen on ice in a cooler. It will be interesting to see what the July sample tests.

07/09/2016,Air temperature 76F- water temperature 75F- winds N 10 mph- sunny- beautiful day but a little windy.

The chlorophyll sample can only be submitted frozen. 
08/23/2020,Sunny day at the lake. It has been hot and very dry but we got rain yesterday.  Air temp 79F- water temp 76F with calm winds.
