Very light winds over the past few days has blown a lake full of algae to the east-NE side- 5-7 hundred yards of algae stacked out from shore line. Very little boat traffic to move surface algae. This is the lowest reading Ive ever taken at this site in over 25 years! 9 inches for clarity reading is correct. I got a 3 ft reading on west side of lake- very- very GREEN!  Lake home buyers run from a home deal when they see the water quality.
09/14/2012,This is the last secchi reading for the year 2012. This reading is being posted on Oct. 21- 2012. Overall the lake stayed very clear up untill early August but turned very green afterward.
