01/07/2010,THIS WAS ONLY A TEST NOT REAL DATA
03/27/2010,When I previously entered the data- the screens for Mill Lake and Green Lake somehow got intermingled.  When I was entering the data for Mill Lake- I noticed that the heading in the upper RH corner said "Green Lake"- yet I was in the Mill lake data entry screen. The secchi data for Mill lake ended up in the Green lake screen- so I'm re-entering the correct secchi data. 
04/10/2010,Windy and choppy. It was difficult at times to see the disc due to the waves. Air temp 66F- sunny and windy.
05/06/2010,Became cloudy as I traveled from Mill Lake to Green. Green lake was very windy and the water was extremely choppy with a strong east wind. I repeated this test 6 times as the secchi readings seemed abnormally low.  Perhaps the readings were a result of the drop in sunlight and higher winds.
05/19/2010,Slight chop on water.
06/10/2010,Moderate wind (out of the east)- more chop than Mill Lake and overcast.
06/24/2010,sunny- slight chop- wind was switching around while we were testing- definite algae bloom
07/09/2010,Lake was busy all week  and the water was very choppy. Daytime high temps were in the upper 80's. Definite algae bloom. 
07/26/2010,Had problems with the HACH meter. The screen fogged up and we couldn't read the temperatures. I was able to correct the problem by warming the meter and drying it out. 
08/12/2010,Lots of boat traffic. Sunny- scattered clouds- Lots of chop due to boar traffic.
