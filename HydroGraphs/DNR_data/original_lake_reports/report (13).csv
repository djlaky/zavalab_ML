08/22/1991,AMBIENT LAKE MONITORING - SUMMER SAMPLE    
03/02/1993,WINTER SAMPLE    
05/12/1993,Sunny- fairly breezy- choppy water.    
07/06/1993,Beautiful and sunny- thick weeds (some type of milfoil) makes motoring difficult if not impossible- algae growth also present.    
07/27/1993,Increasing clouds- warm + humid- some algae clinging to weeds.    
08/24/1993,Sunny- no clouds- breezy.  Eurasian water milfoil and coontail still a major problem- slightly less dense than previous trip but still forms a thick mat in the middle of the lake- around the perimeter as well- but not as thick.    
08/25/1993,SUMMER SAMPLING    
10/18/1993,Cloudy- cool- no breeze.    
05/12/1994,Nice sunny day- few clouds- birds out- divers- crows- turkey vultures on the fields- many fishermen- oaks greening after leafout- weed growth starting not yet in full force.    
06/08/1994,AMBIENT LAKE MONITORING - SUMMER SAMPLE    
07/25/1994,Biggest difference compared to last year is no huge weed matter in the middle of the lake- can motor easily

07/29/2010,sunny- litte breeze- nice day to be out on lake- but water is very murky
08/24/2010,windy
07/28/2011,the sky was overcast- rain is again expected--this prevented me from monitoring sooner.  Lake was murky + dirty 
08/29/2011,sunny weather--pleasant day with some breeze
04/04/2012,windy- waves-- sunny- chilly--no visible plant growth--water very turbid

04/14/2015,sunny--working with Michelle Harrison--lake is very quiet- very little wind--a couple of people fishing in rowboats--lake looks turbid--air temp 60.8 F
06/06/2015,new volunteers John + Nancy Konkel along--Secchi disk reading today was the highest I've ever gotten on Mason Lake in the nearly 13 years I've been testing the lake--could see the bottom in many places- where there were either no aquatic plants or very few--slightly breezy- sunny- upper 70s--a few boats out on the lake- but lake wasn't busy
06/06/2015,sunny (mid-70's) + breezy
07/11/2015,John + Nancy Konkel 

sunny- slight breeze- 79 degrees F.
03/22/2016,air temp in mid 40s--one fishing boat out--no aquatic plant growth noted
08/28/2016,Sunny- calm- 79 degrees Sunny- calm- 79 degrees

To continue monitoring in '17- we need acid + acid labels- phosphorus labels- chlorophyll labels + filters.
07/23/2018,sunny- slight breeze- 70 degrees sunny- slight breeze- 70 degrees
