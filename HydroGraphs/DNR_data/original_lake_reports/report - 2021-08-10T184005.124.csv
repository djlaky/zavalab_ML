07/01/2015,Sam and I had a beautiful day to monitor Bolger Lake. The day reached 75 degrees F and the wind was calm.  We launched the canoe at the public boat landing- paddled the entire shoreline looking for AIS- completed Secchi- temp- and DO- and I snorkeled a high risk area at the south east end. Bolger is a crystal clear lake with several sandy shorelines and lots of curious minnows. There are long stretches of littoral zones- which lack any aquatic vegetation.
INVASIVE SPECIES FOUND:   I identified and collected several Chinese Mystery Snails. The samples were delivered to Sandy Wickman at the DNR office in Rhinelander for further confirmation.  -  Reported by Stephanie Boismenue 

06/24/2016,Calm winds- warm. Lake still slightly green from tree pollen.

07/03/2016,Lake very busy with boat traffic. Some pollen still in water.
07/14/2017,Lake levels are at all time high. Lake seems more cloudy with pollen or run off.
08/29/2017,Lake very high. Water has never been this cloudy green/brown in the 30 years I have lived on lake.
