Not a pretty picture- plus we have a fish kill on the lake- mostly Bluegils and a few Crappies.  I talked to Jeff Scheier- fish biologist out of Park Falls.  He believes it is Columnaries- the right set of circumstance have  occurred.  Water temps in the 65-70 degree range- some recent rain and fish spawning can set off this process- columnaries (bacteria from run-off) will kill the fish that are stressed out from spawning.   Many lakes in the northern basin are reporting fish kills.  No reason to be concerned unless we see massive amounts of dead fish.
06/21/2009,SE winds @ 5-7- cloudy.  Not only do we have a lot of chopped EWM floating around we have a lot of dead Bluegils and some crappies.  Talked to Jeff Scheirer- fish biologist for the DNR working out of Park Falls.  He thought it was columnaries- a bacteria that effects the fish if they are in a stressed condition (like spawning).  They can die in 24 hours- but this was happening in lakes in the entire basin.  He claims it is quite common- but I haven't seen one this bad.
