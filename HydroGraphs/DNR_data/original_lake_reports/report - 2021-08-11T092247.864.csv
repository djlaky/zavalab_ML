06/12/2016,This reading was taken two days after a major storm than knocked down many trees and cut power to entire area.
06/28/2016,Beautiful weather lately- mid 70's during the day and low 50's at night.  However- yesterday was a high of 61 and a low last night of 40.

We had two loon chicks born on 6/18 but unfortunately lost one this morning.  
07/25/2016,5 days of above normal temperatures raised the water temp to 80.3.
08/06/2016,Saw a group of six loons.  Can't find our chick- afraid that it may have met its demise.
08/18/2016,I thought we had lost the loon chick but I did observe it today.
09/23/2016,This reading was followed by the best two hours of fishing I've ever had!
10/25/2016,Last report of year
06/27/2017,Due to numerous either rainy or windy days this is my first report of the year.  Our loon pair had two chicks but- at this point- only one has survived.  

The lake clarity is way down from past years.  I am assuming it is because of all the rain.  the lake water is stained but not cloudy.
