Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
08/23/2006,Partly cloudy- light breeze.  Lake level down by two feet.  correction for the record:  Charnley is spelled with an "n".
09/09/2006,Light chop on lake.  Corrections on and for the deepest part of Charnley Lake will be submitted by Jan.16- 2007.
10/10/2006,Clear day- very light breeze.
07/28/2007,Water still fairly clear- or just beginning to show algae.  Water level very low=3 and a half feet off normal. Water still fairly clear; algae just beginning to bloom.  Water level very low. No wind. Sunny skies.
08/10/2007,Lake level very low. Sunny skies- light breeze.
08/30/2007,Clear skies with a light breeze.  Lake still at a very low level--lowest in 35 years- at least.
06/23/2008,Clear skies- light shop on water- water a bit less clear than it was at last report; and water-level up perhaps a foot and a half since our last report.
07/28/2008,Skies clear- very light chop on water. Water-level down slightly. Little rain recently.
08/19/2008,Clear sky- light ripple on water- which is blue but turning toward green. Water-level is low- and getting lower under drought conditions.
06/11/2009,Loons began sitting on a nest three days ago- a nest on precarilously low and exposed ground.
08/14/2009,Bright sunshine and a very light ripple on the water. I'm guessing- but I suspect that the far cooler than average summer- limiting what algal bloom we have on Charnley Lake- accounts (in part- at least) for the sustained clarity of the water this summer (even despite the very low level of the lake- now well over three feet down from normal levels).
05/19/2010,Clear skies- very little wind- temperature to go to 80-degrees today- water levels as low as anyone living has ever seen them. The drought continues- with a very light algal bloom appearing in water that is still blue in color. The resident pair of loons has now been on one of our two artificial loon-nests (the one to the WSW- in what we call Block's Bay) for ten days or so.
06/10/2010,Partly sunny- a very slight breeze. Water still down substantially (over three feet) from its historic norms. Two baby loons born roughly 5 days ago. Saw an eagle swimming for a hundred yards with a large smallmouth bass in its talens- until it could get to the small island- drag the bass onto shore and up into the grasses- and flap its wings and shake itself for ten minutes or so- before it could regrip its prey and fly off to the unknown site of a nest.
07/19/2010,Lightly overcast with a light chop on the water.
08/21/2010,Partly sunny- light chop on water. Water level has risen since mid June- but is still roughly six inches below its late-summer normal level. The one loon chick of the year- which is slowly learning to fly- is now being left alone on the lake for extended periods of time.
09/06/2010,Sunny- very light chop on the water. Last loons preparing to migrate- etc.
10/10/2010,Sunny at the time of the Secchi test. Winds calm. Water level now up to normal for this time of year. A light agal bloom in the water.
06/05/2011,Clear skies- calm waters- a wonderful day. Loons-having failed in their first nesting attempt- may have established a second nest.
06/25/2011,After recent heavy rains- water clarity is splendid- and water levels are up a bit above historic norms. Note on loons: after failing with an initial nesting attempt (due to disturbance from swimming dogs!)- the loons of Charnley Lake have produced a single chick on a second nesting effort (chick born June 23- Thursday). Clear skies and calm waters for today's measurements.
07/30/2011,A light chop on the water this late morning- but clear skies and clear water. Note on loons: the loon chick born on June 23 died on July 12 (plus or minus a day). Cause of death unknown- but its death probably occurred at night- given the audible evidence of disturbances for two or three nights.
08/28/2011,Clear skies- calm waters- a beautiful morning. No algal bloom- but therefore limited phytoplankton. Water-level still high- and the loons are gathering for migration in the early mornings and late evenings.
05/08/2012,Mostly cloudy- with sun breaking through briefly- light wind. Pair of loons in residence.
05/31/2012,Mostly sunny skies- two territorial loons- light breeze- and one dead owl hung up on a lure on the highwire at the north end of the lake.
07/07/2012,After a .6" overnight rain- the waters of Charnley Lake are crystral clear- a bit surprisingly after a recent heatwave. Mostly sunny skies- with a light chop on the water. Wind ENE at about 10 mph. No successful loon nesting this year- too many eagles early on.
07/28/2012,Utterly clear skies- utterly calm water- and clear blue skies. No significant algal bloom after an inch and a half of rain over the last few days- despite recent high temperatures. A record depth for clarity reading at high noon.
08/13/2012,Under overcast skies- with a chop on the waters of Charnley Lake- and after refurbishing the vegetation the loon nesting platform (with the help of David Fantl)- I ran a Secchi-dish test on water clarity. The water is still notably clear of algae- even in mid-August of a hot summer.
08/29/2012,Very light green tinge inshore to Charnley's normally blue waters. Clear skies- bright sun- and a light SW wind giving a light chop to waters. Local hummingbirds are leaving a bit early.
09/29/2013,Chop on the water- but clear blue skies.  A bit of an algal bloom- but only slight.  One loon left on the lake.
05/28/2014,Clear skies- light breeze. Water level very high- and characteristic blue slightly tinted by a tannin color- I suspect from this year's extremely high waters. Resident loons still deciding on nesting site.
07/04/2014,Water still showing a slight tinge of tannin coloring- most likely due to very high level of water. Clear- sunny skies; very light chop on water.
07/24/2014,Clear skies- very light breeze from the west- water still showing a bit of a tannin shade (from the very high water level- I suspect).
09/17/2014,Clear skies- light breeze- a beautiful day. Two mergansers- two kingfishers- and one loon on and around Charnley Lake.  A tough- highly insectivorous summer- with extremely high water levels (to which I attribute the rather striking change in water clarity compared to historic norms). All summer- the historical blue waters of Charnley have shown a noticeable tannin-shade- presumably a function of high water working the color and materials of shoreline vegetation and its remains.
05/31/2015,Mostly sunny- very light wind. Loons have started nesting on the north- inside corner of the big island.  We wish them the best of luck- since their earlier attempts to locate on the little island were protested  by geese who were nesting 100 yards away.
07/01/2015,Blue skies- light NW breeze- very high water level. Loons nesting attempt on the north shore of the big island failed on June 8/9. Specific cause unknown- but probably a swimming predator of some kind.
07/19/2015,Mostly sunny skies- West wind at 10 or so- very high water levels- but clear blue to the eye.
08/29/2015,Sunny skies- blue waters- and a very slight breeze. Water levels continue to be high. Today's reading thanks to the aid of David and Karen Fantl.
10/11/2015,Clear skies- a light chop on the water- a beautiful day. The last loons left this morning- one adult and one juvenile who had joined the remaining adult for the last three weeks or so.
05/30/2016,Clear Sky- light chop on water- pine pollen on and in water- along with what I will call algal detritus from heavy rains for the last five days or so (3" in 5 days)- and more rain to come. The resident pair of loons has abandoned 2 eggs on our platform-nest- even with its chicken wire ceiling and dead branches. Indirect evidence suggests that the best explanation for the abandonment is a marauding eagle (and/or perhaps the small black flies that trouble loons). The loon-pair was nesting by May 5- and the nest was abandoned (with eggs- which are still present) on May 21.
07/03/2016,Sunny skies- a light westerly breeze--all in all- a beautiful day. I was assisted this day by my grandson- Paul Fritzell. The loons of Charnley Lake have tried valiantly to put together a successful nesting this year- but they have failed.
07/25/2016,After recent hot weather and with the high water levels of the last few years- the waters of Charnley Lake are slightly darker than their historic clear blue and very slightly more cloudy. Today we have a good WNW wind and sunny skies.
08/17/2016,Clear waters- blue skies- no wind. Slight increase in the amount of algae this year- and slightly increasing lake-bottom vegetation in shallow water- after what have been effectively three years of very high water levels. In early August we had as many as 6 "visiting" or socializing loons on the lake- thus making a summer's single-moment group of 8. At this date- one lonely resident loon is still on the lake- occasionally joined by one or two others.
09/09/2016,With the continuing help of Ron Marose- I did a Secchi disk-reading early this afternoon. Skies were lightly overcast- and decent chop was on the water. Both he and I were a bit surprised to find that the Secchi-reading was 14.5 feet- deeper than one might expect to find it in this year of very high water- and perhaps especially after the 3 inches of rain we had over roughly 18 hours just four and five days ago. We reasoned that perhaps the heavy rains at this late-summer time of year had cleansed and cleared the water a bit.
07/03/2017,Blue skies- calm waters- recent heavy rains (and consequently increased tannin coloring in water. One baby loon hatched on June 11/12- which baby is today making it through some of the traffic of the weekend of July 4th.
07/17/2017,Today's reading was again aided by David Fantl- thanks to whom. Like other historically clear or blue water lakes in the Springstead area- Charnley is experiencing both increased tannin coloring and increased algal production--at least in part- one surmises- because of the inordinately high water of the last three and a half years or so. This year's loon chick (one of two to hatch) continues to thrive- with only occasional disturbances. Clear skies today- with a moderate breeze. 
08/10/2017,Cloudy skies- slight ripple on the water. Aid in readings from Dave Fantl. Our young loon continues to progress.
05/26/2018,Loons continue on their nest on the north tip of the Big Island. Sunny- with a slight ripple on the water. The loons continue on their nest on the north tip of the Big Island.
06/14/2018,Cloudy and calm with tree pollen in the water. The loons continue sitting on their nest.
06/29/2018,Two loon chicks are growing apace- and what a pace. Two loon chicks are growing apace- and what a pace. Overcast and breezy.
08/10/2018,Sunny- slight breeze- and a noticeable algal bloom (for Charnley).
09/01/2018,One loon chick still surviving- being fed heavily by one parent. Overcast skies- slight rain- choppy waters- and a slight bloom of suspended algae.
09/03/2018,Sunny with a slight ripple on the water.
06/15/2019,Lake level is very high- and pollen levels are high.
07/11/2019,Lake and pollen levels have dropped.
07/14/2019,Lake and pollen levels continue to moderate.Globs of algae beginning to appear in shallow water.
08/04/2019,Beautiful morning- sunny skies- very light breeze. Surface temperature reading of 77.8.
08/06/2019,Algae level down- skies bright blue- slight chop on the water. Charnley's territorial pair of loons continue to hold their own.
08/10/2019,Temperature 73- sunny with a slight chop. Surface temperature is 77.4. The water level is high but has dropped from July.  Pollen is still present but reduced from July.  Spotted some algae in the lake.  Two loons were present on the lake.   (Note: this should be date for Satellite path 26)
08/11/2019,Temperature 71- partly cloudy with a slight chop. Surface temperature is 77.6. The water level is high but has dropped from July.  Pollen is still present but reduced from July.  Spotted some algae in the lake.  One loon was spotted on the lake.   (Note: this should be date for Satellite path 25)
08/31/2019,Lake Height:  slightly above average
Water:  Pollen level (medium/low) is present but reduced from early August
Weather: 64degrees and complete cloud cover with slight chop on water
Two Loons were spotted on the lake
09/21/2019,Starting to see fall colors on trees- spotted one loon on the lake- water level on lake is a little high for this time of year- it was raining while I was taking the readings- so completely overcast with clouds and the lake had waves due to higher winds.
05/23/2020,Overcast morning with a ripple on the lake. There were two loons on the lake feeding by the large island. This reading should align with satellite passing.
05/30/2020,Air Temperature was 53F; Cloudy; windy with chop on lake. Sign of slight tree pollen on lake.  Spotted one loon on lake and heard the other as they were wailing due to eagle flying overhead.
06/13/2020,Overcast with Ripple on lake- Saw single loon by small island
06/18/2020,Partly sunny with ripples on lake. 
07/18/2020,Air temperature was 77C- Calm waters and partly sunny.  Saw a pair of loons and one loon landed.
08/03/2020,Sunny with and air temperature of 61.1.  Lake had a slight chop.
08/06/2020,Air temperature was 69.1- partly sunny and a slight chop on the lake.  Spotted two loons on the south side of the big island.
09/04/2020,Partly sunny- with some wind.  Air temperature is 55.2.  Did not see any Loons or animals this morning.
09/25/2020,Overcast Morning+ slight chop on water:  the Lake level is high for this time of year; air temp was 53.6
10/31/2020,Windy conditions with chop on lake- Cloudy with an air temp of 50.5.  Did not notice any wildlife.
