06/29/2003,wind 5mph- water temp 75.3- lots of weeds along
shore-fisherman's son on dock- nice day
    
07/22/2003,The lake was real nice and calm. Wind about
5mp. No one on the lake. Was a guy with a net
trying to find some car keys in the water next
to the dock.That boat landing needs a lot of
work. The tongue of the trailer hit before 1/2
of the boat is in the water.  Makes it hard to launch.       
08/30/2003,The boat launch on the lake is so bad it is
almost inpossible to launch your boat. I may
not do this lake next year if this is not taken care of. I called the
county parks and rec last month. They were going to look into the problem.
Have not done anything with the launch at all. I'll try and finish this
year if I don't wreck
my boat trailer before the year is done. Something has to be done out
there. Is there anything you can do or say to get this problem
taken care of     
05/23/2012,sunny calm day.
07/11/2012,windy 
08/16/2012,clam. Gene Weyer was along. Took water sample and just rode around to look the lake over. Gene Weyer along. Took water sample and rode around lake just to look it over.

07/19/2013,Sunny-light wind. 4 people fishing from dock catching small bluegill-s is all
08/25/2014,Lake had light chop. A man swiming when I strated and one fishing when I left. Nothing caught. A Blue heron on the lake.Fish where hitting the surface after bug's.
 The landing needs some help. When the put it in this spring. It drops off to fast and the boat tongue hit's and hanges up
on the front of the landing. I told them about it last year and nothing has been done. I won't wreck my boat trailer launching there if they don't fix it..
