06/06/2004,There is a loon on the lake that is gray and white instead of black and white. It is probably a two year old loon that came back up north a year early and is still in juvenile plumage.

04/21/2007,Air Temperature  67.8 degrees.  Sunny- but windy day.  One loon on the lake.
05/14/2007,There are 2 loons on the lake today and a male and female turkey walking down the driveway. Air temperature today is 83.3.
06/10/2007,The weather was sunny and very warm this weekend after the big storm.  The loons are still on the nest.  We had a black bear visitor this weekend.  It was a small bear- about 110 lbs.  It appeared at the back door while I was doing breakfast dishes.  Perhaps the smell of the bacon was too much to pass up.  It also came back while we were cooking on the grill.  It is a nice looking bear but we have been discouraging visits with noise- yelling and clapping.
07/04/2007,The loons have one chick left and it is getting big.  It is diving now- but it still stays close to a parent.  
The small bear is still wandering through the yards.  It may be due to the fact that because it is so dry there is very little for the bears to eat in the woods.  We have raspberry bushes around the back of the garage but there are no berries ripening this year.  A neighbor that I talked to said he was riding around and there are no berries anywhere.  
07/21/2007,The young loon is getting big and is still following the adult around.  When the adult dives the young one follows with its head under the water.  The small black bear is still walking through the yard.  We have a few raspberries on the bushes and the blueberries are getting ripe also.  The lake is very- very low.  The triple sedge around the dock is not even in the water anymore and there are a lot more areas of lily pads.
08/04/2007,The air temp is 86.9.  It is a beautiful day.  The juvenile loon is getting a white chest.  His head is grayish and his body feathers are spotted gray.  The adult leaves the lake a lot so the juvenile is alone most of the time.  It is diving for fish and doing quite well it appears.  We were able to see it catch several fish while we were watching.
09/01/2007,The weather is beautiful  84.2 degrees.  The young loon is still on the lake.  We have not seen the adults lately.  The bear has not shown up either.  The lake is down about 2.5 feet.
09/16/2007,It was about 60 degrees today.  A little overcast and windy but overall very nice.  We did not see the loon or any hummingbirds.  Perhaps they have gone south.  The otter is still around and munching on fish under the dock.  A 6 point buck came down the driveway and we saw 2 turkeys across the road.  We pulled the spotted knapweed that was growing along the road and will burn it after it dries out.  
09/26/2007,Sunny day.  Temp  68

10/21/2007,The gray jays are back - a sign of colder weather coming.  The ruffed grouse seem to be abundant this year.  We have seen several on the land by the cabin.  The weather was beautiful on Saturday but when we were leaving on Sunday it was raining the cold- sleety rain that sometimes turns into snow.  
05/03/2008,It is 51.6 degrees today.  The heron has been fishing and an osprey did a flyby.
05/17/2008,The loons- heron- hummingbirds- bats and bears are back.   I hope they are as happy to see us as we are to see them.   It is 63.8 degrees today.
06/01/2008,It is 73.9 degrees today- and sunny.  The loon is nesting on the old fish crib that is stuck in the shallows of the southeast bay.  One of the loons has a blue band on the left leg but we have not been able to see any other bands yet.
06/19/2008,It is overcast today but the air temp is 80.0 so it is very nice.  We had a visit from a bear again this week.  It came back a couple of times while making its rounds of the lake.  The loon is still sitting on her eggs.  The male is banded.  He was banded on Pine Lake in May 2007.  Our friends that have a cabin on the other side of the lake said they saw a wolf by our driveway when they went past.  Our nephew also said he saw a wolf when he was out on the ATV.
07/05/2008,The bear made an appearance again.  It does not seem very afraid of people- this could be bad for the bear.  The loon had one chick but unfortunately something attacked them on Sunday night (June 29th) and no one has seen the loon or the chick since then.  
The weather for the weekend was beautiful but there was a pall over the lake because of the loon tragedy.


08/10/2008,It was a beautiful weekend.  We are still fighting with the spotted knapweed.  It seems we have pulled it all- but every time we check again there is more.  We have not seen the bear lately.  Late Sat. night I heard howling but am not sure what animal was doing it.
08/31/2008,The weekend was beautiful.  We saw 2 ospreys circling while we were doing the secchi readings.  We have not seen the bear lately so hopefully it is finding enough food in the woods and can leave the feeders alone.  We seem to have made some headway with the spotted knapweed and are now working on getting rid of the non native St. John's Wort.
10/12/2008,We pulled the dock up today.  That always makes it seem like summer is over.  There are still robins around though and a painted turtle was sitting on the log with 7 mallards for company.  We saw 1 turkey in the driveway and 2 ruffed grouse.  We  saw a tree frog while we were planting oak and nut trees in the woods.  
11/01/2008,It was 52 degrees today.  The chick-a-dees were at the feeder almost before I got it hung up.  We checked the wood duck boxes and found evidence of nesting in 2 of the boxes.  We have seen hooded mergansers flying into the boxes so it would seem that they would be the birds using the nest boxes.  Each of the boxes had 1 egg that had not hatched.  There were remains of egg shells in both of the boxes.  We thought it  looked like the shells of about 2-3 hatched eggs.   

Seven mallards and a turtle  spent a lot of time on the log by the dock.  The weather is getting pretty cold and there is snow left in some areas along the road.  This may be the last time that we will be here before the lake freezes over.  


05/10/2009,The loons are back on the lake and being very vocal at night.  I did see a blue band on the right leg of one of the loons.  It had a white (or silver) band below the blue band.  I will check again next time we are up.  
We did not see the bear but the bird feeders were pulled down onto the ground so we cannot leave them out at nigt any more.
The bats are also back and making themselves at home in the attic.  
We had a little snow mixed with the rain on Saturday.
05/24/2009,The hummingbirds- loons and bats are back.  The loons have 2 eggs on their nest and the eagle is keeping an eye on that.  I counted 136 bats leaving the cabin between 9:00 and 9:20 PM on Friday night
05/31/2009,The loon is still sitting on the eggs.  One of the loons has blue over white bands on the right leg and blue over silver bands on the left leg.  It was a very cold and windy weekend.  We saw several flocks of geese fly over heading north.  
06/14/2009,The loons have 2 chicks.  We have seen a lot of turtles this year.  The weather was beautiful most of the weekend.
07/19/2009,Sunday was a beautiful day upnorth. 
08/06/2009,I am still fighting the spotted knapweed.  I filled a garbage bag with them again this week.  I have been spreading the seeds from the lupine that got cut down when the county mowed the sides of the road.  Perhaps the spread of the lupine will help in my fight.  
We saw a bear again at 11:00 pm. on Tuesday.  That must be the time it gets to our yard when making the rounds of the lake.  The neighbor said it must have weighed 500 lbs.  but I have seen fish and heard fish stories so I am going to say the bear was 350 to 400 lb.  It was about 4 feet tall at the shoulder.  It was standing next to a fence that was 4 feet high so that is how I am making my height determination.  
08/30/2009,Kurt saw a black bear go through the yard at 6:15 PM on Thursday.  That is pretty early for the bear to be out and about but some people across the lake were using a back hoe and may have gotten the bear moving out of that area.  On Saturday it was drizzly and cold but we saw a coyote heading down the driveway- probably checking for mice or chipmunks.  It was 11:00 AM but I wasn't fast enough to get a picture of the coyote- but we did get one of the scat that was left for us. 
09/06/2009,On the way up  to the cabin on Friday night (9/4/09)  we saw a white deer standing in a clearing on the side of Hwy 51.  It was on the west side of the highway between Island Lake Road and N Townline Road in  Vilas County. This was a first for us.  We have seen pictures of them but did not expect to see the real thing.
While I was pulling the dreaded spotted knapweed along the road a pileated woodpecker flew right by me.  There was a pile of bear scat on the road and another pile in the front yard.   
The weather was beautiful- sunny and 70 degrees.  
09/14/2009,We found 2 bats staying in the bat house we have attached to the oar house. (The shed where we keep the boats.)   I am hopeful more will take up residence there because if the cabin ever comes down we will need to construct something for the 161 bats that live in the attic.  The lake water was very- very clear this weekend.  Even the neighbors commented on it.  We saw a few flocks of geese heading south.  There were 11 mallards sitting on the "turtle log" in the bay by the dock.  The male was not as colorful as he was in summer.  It was a beautiful weekend but we really need more rain.  74 degrees and sunny. 
10/17/2009,On the way up to the cabin we saw a coyote.  The robins are still at the cabin.  We just stayed Sat.  We pulled up the dock and put all the boats away.  It was a nice day and we hate for summer to be over.
04/03/2010,It was cloudy and windy all day and about 40 degrees.  We saw three otters on the lake when we got there on Friday.  There were no loons on the lake yet but it is totally open.  The bats weren't back yet either.  The lupine is about an inch tall and the apple trees we planted look like they made it through the winter. 
05/23/2010,Both loons were on the nest today.  The male is banded but the female has no bling to show off.  There was an eagle swooping down on them today.  The adults would go under the water and they really raised a ruckus.

I counted the bats last night.  I may have missed some at the beginning but I counted 120 leaving the cabin between 9PM and 10PM.

The hummingbirds are back also and the Jack in the Pulpit is up.  Unfortunately so is the spotted knapweed.  We filled another bag of it on Saturday.  We do have to go farther to find it though.  We found most of it on Shea Road.
06/26/2010,The loons are still at the lake but we did not see any chicks.  There is a robin nesting above the lights on the oar house.  Perhaps she will have better luck with her family.  We counted 258 bats as they came out of the cabin from 9 to 9:30 PM.  The air was calm and it was 70 degrees.  The mosquitos were out and so thick I felt like I was at the World Cup in South Africa listening to the vuvuzelas.  We got a start on finding a trail for the frog monitoring we will do this summer.  We taped the sounds at several places and besides frogs and loons the mosquitos were the loudest. 
07/15/2010,We did the secchi today in case it is raining on the 16th which is the satelite day.  We were up for the week and it was wonderful.  We saw a black bear in the yard at 4:11 AM on Sunday (11th).  We counted 251 bats coming from the attic one night.  We saw a turkey and 4 chicks waiting to cross the highway on our way to Minoqua.  We also saw several does with fawns.  The wind/rain storm we had knocked down the robin's nest that was on the lights above the shed door.  We could not find the chick so I hope it was old enough to be out of the nest.  When we did the frog survey we recorded the calls so we could check them out with the frog recording  that we have.  On our last stop we heard wolves calling so it is on my tape.  Very exciting!  It was a very good week.
07/16/2010,On Saturday (July 17th) we did the loon count on Deer Lake for Loon Watch.  It is a beautiful lake.  We saw 6 loons but only one counted  because the others flew in after we started the count.  It was a great way to spend a beautiful morning.
08/15/2010,We went on Sunday to take down an aspen  tree that fell on the outhouse.   We scattered black walnuts in the woods where the land was logged. We went on Sunday to take down an aspen  tree that fell on the outhouse.   We scattered black walnuts in the woods where the land was logged.  It was windy and overcast but a good day to get work done.
08/29/2010,It was a beautiful sunny day.  The hummingbirds are still around.
09/11/2010,It was 65 degrees today.  The bats are still in the bat house on the shed.  There was a tree down across the driveway when we came in and one that fell in the front yard.  It fell in the path so nothing but the ground was damaged.  It left several holes about 6 inches deep in the ground where the limbs fell.  
We pulled more spotted knapweed - no matter how much I pull it seems to come back in a few spots.
10/03/2010,It was 50 degrees and sunny.  There are still robins in the yard.   On the way back from the Applefest in Bayfield a black bear and cub crossed Hwy 51 in front of our car.  We also saw 7 turkeys feeding along  the side of the road when we went to Mercer.
05/15/2011,We found 2 dead bats in the cabin.  We also found one alive.  We put it outside but it was dead in the morning.  We are having a hard time finding out where they are getting into the cabin.  There are many ways for them to get from the outside into the attic and they have a nursery there.  But once they find a way into the cabin they can't get back into the attic.  
There are 2 loons on the lake and there is one egg on the nest so far.  They do not seem to mind the people on the lake.  I hope the eagles leave them alone this year.
There were 7 painted turtles sunning on the fallen tree in the bay.
05/22/2011,There were 4 painted turtles on the log.  The loons now have 2 eggs on the nest.
06/11/2011,The loon is still on her nest with 2 eggs.  The bass are on their beds and the turtles are sunning on the fallen log.  We planted some more apple trees and put the dock in.  It was cool enough for us to work outside.  60 degrees and overcast. The loon is still incubating 2 eggs.  If our calculations are right the chicks should hatch in a few days. The loon is still incubating 2 eggs.  If our calculations are right the chicks should hatch in a few days.
07/15/2011,The 2 mallard families are still on the lake.  One still has her 8 chicks and the other still has her 5.  The group with the 5 chicks are not very people shy.  The hen comes up on the dock and watches the chicks in the little bay.  If I lay on the dock with my hand in the water the chicks will eat cracked corn out of the palm of my hand.  The hen is very watchful  and keeps her distance and only eats the corn that we throw out to her.  
10/01/2011,We pulled the dock up and started the winter clean-up.  We did not see any hummingbirds but the blue jays and robins and mallards are still around.  An eagle landed in the tree across the lake and sat for quite a while and an otter was swimming in the bay.   
04/29/2012,There were 2 loons on the lake today.  They did not use the nest raft but were swimming and fishing together.  A porcupine came up the driveway- climbed a tree and ate some leaf buds.  We planted 10 white oak- 10 black oak and 5 black walnut trees.  The big question---will the deer leave them alone long enough to grow   Something (a robin ) built a nest in the blue spruce we planted when we were up in March.  (It was our Christmas tree)  However- the nest is only about a foot and a half above the ground.  It is a very neat and deep nest but I don't know why it would have been built so close to the ground.   
 It was 50 degrees and sunny today but very windy.
05/11/2012,We came up for a long weekend and it was great.  On Friday morning there was a coyote in the driveway.  At first we weren't sure if it was a coyote or a wolf.  Kurt looked at the feet and they weren't big enough to be a wolf's.  When it put it's head up we saw it had a narrow- "laughing" face so we are pretty sure it was a coyote.  
The bats are back-  however the little bitting midges are back also and they are hungry.
On Sunday we were packed up to leave and so we took one last walk down to the lake.  On the way down we could hear a lot of peeping.  The merganser had called her chicks out of the nest box in the big pine tree in the garden.  She had about 8 chicks with her and was halfway to the lake.  One chick was still by the garden and running to catch up with her.  It was peeping the loudest of all.  The merganser waited in the water and the last chick caught up with her.  They all swam under the dock and away from the shore.  They were about halfway between the dock and the loons nest when one of the loons came up out of the water.  The loon did its "Penguin Dance" and charged the merganser.  The chicks all scattered.  There was a lot of wing flappping- hooting and chasing.  The merganser swam to the shore line and the chicks managed to follow her.  Once she and the chicks were in the shoreline plants the loon settled down and swam away quietly.
05/19/2012,The hummingbirds are back and fighting over the sugar water.  The loons have 2 eggs on the nest and a robin has built a nest on the ladder that hangs on the side of the garage.  After reading an article about red-winged blackbirds we thought the nest in the pine tree might be one of theirs.  It was 86 degrees and sunny and windy.
06/02/2012,It was 65 and windy.  The loon is still sitting on 2 eggs.  We have more bats in the bat house on the shed.  The mallard has 9 chicks and the robin is still sitting on her nest.
06/23/2012,There was a storm on Wedsnesday and it rained so much that the end of the dock that should be on shore was floating in the water.  There were 2 hooded mergansers sitting on the turtle log.  On Wednesday the loon was on the lake with 2 chicks.  Then on Thursday they were gone.  We are wondering if they went through the culvert to Pine Lake.
07/04/2012,Tuesday night (July 3) there was a big wind storm.  It knocked down two big dead trees in the yard.  One fell next to the shed and between the arbor vitae bushes and didn't damage anything.  The other fell behind the garden.  It was one with a woodduck box on it.  The branches kept the box off the ground so no damage was done by that tree either.  It was really hot all week.  The mallards come to the dock for corn and are hardly afraid of the kids swimming close to them.  Very warm  91 degrees
07/22/2012,We saw a loon on the lake but no chicks.  The mallard is still there with her band of 7.  The water is really low- but warm enough for swimming.   Kurt saw 3 otters on the lake.
08/12/2012,We saw a turkey crossing Little Pine Road when we drove in on Saturday morning and Saturday night I saw a flying squirrel sitting on one of the bird feeders.
08/19/2012,There is a loon back on the lake and the hummingbirds are still around.  We saw the coyote in the driveway again.  The weather was beautiful.  77 degrees.  The lake is about a foot and a half low.
09/03/2012,It was a very quiet weekend on the lake.  The hummingbirds are still around and there was a Canada goose on the lake.  While we were painting the garage we found a tiger swallowtail caterpillar and a pale tussock moth caterpillar.  I don't think we have bats in the cabin anymore this year.  The attic where they ususally are is not ventilated  and if it was 80 to 90 degrees in the cabin it was probably 100 degrees in the attic.  There are bats in the bat houses on the shed and garage.  The lake is VERY low.  We can walk out about 5 feet from the regular shore line.
09/30/2012,We don't have any bats in the cabin but there are 3 in the bat houses on the shed.  We had a turkey that came for the bird seed in the driveway.  She posed long enough for a picture.  We also had a double-crested cormorant on the lake.  I got a picture but it was from quite far away.  
10/13/2012,When we were cleaning the garage we saw 3 gray jays.  We have not seen them for a few years.  There are still robins here too.  We got the dock in and the pontoon boat out.  When we did the temperature reading most of the readings were 46.2 degrees.  At first I thought the monitor might not be working.  To check it  I pulled the  device out of the water and held it in my hand.   It warmed up and showed the temperature changes so I am reporting the temperature readings that I got.  Saturday was quite nice.  It was overcast but the temperature was quite pleasant for all the work we had to do.
10/20/2012,The weather was nice this weekend.  I spread more milkweed seeds on the bare spots along Little Pine Road.  Kurt went grouse hunting.  He saw a lot but didn't get any.  Three trumpeter swans flew over.  They may have been going to land on the lake but there were quite a few people outside working so they just flew over.  We also saw a pileated woodpecker in the tree by the bird feeder.
10/28/2012,It was very windy this weekend.  We trimmed the oak and apple trees and put the last of the boats away.  Two woodducks were on the lake for a while.  
05/18/2013,The weather was beautiful.  We were going to leave on Sat. because rain was forecast but it only rained Fri. night and Sat was fine.  We put the dock in on Fri. with the end of the dock at the edge of the water.  It rained enough on Fri. night that the first dock piece was under water.  There were two loons on the lake.  I couldn't tell if they were the same two that come and nest every year.  The bats are also back!!!  yeah!!!   We also had 3 deer in the yard along with chipmunks- red squirrels- and jack rabbits.  There were 3 otters in the lake - I hope they leave the loons alone.  We also saw pileated  woodpeckers-  geese- crows- blue jays- robins- chick-a-dees-  hummingbirds- sparrows- white breasted nuthatches- a turkey- hooded mergansers and an eagle being mobbed by crows.  At 4:41 on Sat. we saw the female merganser go into the nest box.  The male was in the lake and was making a "barking" noise.  When we went out in the yard we could see the female sitting in the hole of the nest box.  Her head and breast were sticking out.  The male kept calling and after a while the female flew down to the lake and another female flew out of the box right after her.  The merganser "couple" kept chasing the lone female around the bay until she swam away from them.    The spring peepers were in great vocal form and the 9 turtles on the "turtle log"  didn't mind us being on the dock at all.
'
06/01/2013,On Friday afternoon the neighbors saw the loons sitting on the nest.  While they were gone a wind storm went through.  It was strong enough to blow their rowboat up onto their pontoon boat and take down trees.  The loon raft must have had the anchor rope break because the nest was aground in the north bay.  This was about 150 yards away from its original site.  We got up here at 8:30 PM.  It was dark and rainy.  On Saturday morning (6/1/13) when we went down to the lake we saw that our raft was gone.  It was on the south west corner of the lake.  We took our pontoon boat to retrieve the raft and then went to find the nest.  We pulled it to our dock so we could work on it in shallow water.  All the while we were doing this one of the loons was swimming where the nest used to be.  We put 2 new anchors on it and pulled it back out into the deeper water.  The second loon flew in while we were doing this and they both kept circling us and the nest raft as we were putting it in place.  They came within 20 feet of us.  After we left they swam around- inspecting the nest.  Then they started swimming together and diving together.  At about 5:30 we saw her sitting on the nest again.  In the evening they were swimming together and hooting quietly to each other.  We left on Sunday and did not see any eggs on the nest yet.  There had been at least one  before the nest was blown into shore because we found one broken egg shell on the raft.  We don't know if it was broken because of the storm or if some animal got to it while it was aground.  We will be going up next week so we will see if they re-nest.
06/12/2013,The loons did not re-nest.  We only saw one loon on the lake.  I don't know if it was the male or the female.  There are turkeys nearby.  One woke us up at 4:00 AM.  Just like having a rooster around--but bigger.  There is a bass over his nest at the end of the dock.  He was probably glad to see us go home so he didn't have to swim into the weeks every time we walked onto the dock.  Someone saw the hooded merganser fly out of the nest box so we may get chicks there.
06/27/2013,I didn't see any loons on the lake but the female merganser  was still there.  She may like it better without the loons since they chased her and her chicks last year when she took them to the water.  The mosquitos were vicious as usual and the deer flies were out too.  
07/08/2013,The lake is high.  We had to add a board to the end of the dock so we wouldn't have to step in water.  The lupine is done blooming.  We missed seeing it at its best this year.  Our grandchildren were up for the week so we rode the pontoon boat- paddle boats- canoed and swam.  We also took the fishing boat out on Pine Lake.  The oak trees seem to have grown about 3 feet this year.  With all the rain we had the mosquitos were plentiful but it was a great week to be in the north woods.
07/20/2013,The weather was in the 60's which is a lot better for me than the 80's and 90's are.  The lake seems to be back to its normal depth.  The dock isn't in the water and the yard isn't full of puddles.   The mosquitos are still as active as ever.  I cleaned the guano from the chimney space.  I wonder if there is anyone that could use the guano that has accumulated in the attic.  We have had about 100 bats there every summer for at least 20 years and the guano is in deep piles.  
07/31/2013,Two loons were back on the lake today.  It was a beautiful day--70 degrees and breezy.  The breeze kept the mosquitos away.  :)
08/10/2013,The weather was beautiful.  An osprey made a couple of fly overs chased by the crows.  At about 10:30 PM we heard a lot of scratching noises and a raccoon was sitting on the front porch.  I think he lives under the cabin.
08/24/2013,The day was clear and sunny but very windy.  76 degrees.   The wind kept most of the mosquitos away!!
09/26/2013,We were up for the week and there were 4 turkeys in the driveway almost every morning.  One night we heard wolves howling.  There was a full moon and the nights were beautiful.  
05/25/2014,The loons are back.  They may have been back for a while but this is our first time up this year.  We've seen the bats- lots of guano by the garage also.  A duck went into the wood duck box- it was probably the hooded merganser- since that is what usually nests there.  The were seven painted turtles on the "turtle log".  The weather was beautiful but the gnats are horrible.  Perhaps these are not the gnats I am used to at home because these are bigger and they bite!!  My arms- neck and face are swollen from the bites.
06/21/2014,We only saw one loon on the lake.  It was on the nest most of the time we were watching.  Hopefully both of the parents are around and one is just dining at another lake.  We have not seen any deer or turkeys this summer but there are a lot of rabbits.  The bats are back also.  They still don't seem to make a dent in the mosquito population.  The dragonflies are out and about but so are the horseflies.  Even the gnats bite this year.
06/29/2014,We are up for the week.  It has been very windy.  It rains at night and gets very hot and sunny during the day.  The mosquitos are extremely blood thirsty.  The loon is still sitting on the nest.  We have not been able to see how many eggs there are there.  On Sunday (June 29) both loons were on the lake.   Sunday evening we had a hail storm.  The hail was quite large.  The loon was still on the nest on Monday so it must have all made it through the storm.  On the way to the cabin on Saturday we saw a large turkey crossing Little Pine Road so some made it through the winter.  We have not seen any deer yet.   
07/15/2014,There is one loon on the lake.  The egg is still sitting on the nest but the loons are not with it.  We will have to ask the neighbors on the lake if they know what happened.  We finally saw a deer in the yard.  I was beginning to think the hard winter had taken all of them.  Tom saw a coyote on the logging road on the east side of the road.  The mosquitoes are not as bad as they were a couple of weeks ago but the horseflies are out now.  
07/26/2014,Our neighbors bought a new place on Spider Lake.  On our way to see them we saw a coyote on the side of the road.  (We assume coyote not wolf)  The weather has been beautiful and the mosquitos are not as bad as they were at the beginning of the summer.
08/09/2014,We have one loon that stays on the lake but 4 flew over the lake today.  Kurt heard a pileated woodpecker.  The weather was hot and sunny.
08/24/2014,The day was overcast and the breeze was out of the southwest.  We were working hard moving stuff so the breeze was very welcome.  The temp was 72.  We did a spotted knapweed walk and collected 2 garbage bags full.  We will burn them sometime this winter.
05/23/2015,It was a beautiful day.  The loon was on the nest so hopefully we will see some chicks.  When we got back to the shore after the secchi reading there were 2 Canada geese walking across the front lawn.
05/31/2015,The spring peepers and green frogs are out and announcing their presence.  The bats are in the bat houses on the shed and leaving me guano for the garden.  On the way home a deer was running the wrong way down the middle of the south bound lane of hwy 51.  Facing traffic is probably easier than facing the mosquitos.
06/21/2015,There are two loons on the lake and egg shells on the nest but no sign of chicks.  In all the years we have been on the lake we have only seen 1 chick that survived to be old enough to leave on its own.  The chalk-fronted corporals-  common green darners and damsel flies are out and about.  The green frogs are very noisy and of course the ever present mosquitos.  The bats don't seem to make a dent in that population.
06/30/2015,The mosquitoes are thick.  We have not seen the loons or any chicks.
07/18/2015,It was sunny and 83 degrees.  This is supposed to be the hottest day of the year.  We did the Wisconsin Loon Population Survey this morning on Deer Lake.  It was raining when we got up at 5:30 but by 7:30 when we got to the lake it was beautiful.  We saw one loon on the lake and then at 7:22 another loon flew in (but that one doesn't count in the survey.  Still- it was nice to see the two swimming around together.
07/23/2015,It was really hot and sunny.  All was quiet on the lake- probably because it was a week day and no one was at their cottages.
04/15/2016,It was a busy weekend at the lake.  The loon was back on the lake and the spring peepers are very noisy.  The bats were out at dark.  It was good to see them back.  The blue and yellow crocuses are blooming and the daffodils are up.  We also saw white breasted nut hatches- robins- crows- turkey vulture- chick-a-dees- a kingfisher- bluejays and mallards.  The hooded merganser came out of the nest box at 11:30 (lunch with the girls maybe).  There were painted turtles on the log and the red squirrels were also out and about.  When we were on the way to Mercer we also saw a turkey and a ruffed grouse. 
04/23/2016,This weekend was not as busy as last weekend.  We did see 17 turtles on the log sunning themselves.   There were 2 loons on the lake and 2 mallards flew in.  The bluejays were very busy in the yard and we could hear a woodpecker in the trees.  We also saw a flicker and saw and heard a red squirrel.  
06/26/2016,It was very windy today so I think the Secchi reading was lower because of he waves.  While we were doing the reading 9 turkey vultures flew or were wind blown over the lake.  We see a lot of white admiral butterflies and chalk-fronted corporal dragonflies on the dock.  The mallard and 6 ducklings also use the dock for sunning on nice days.  A yellow bellied sap sucker is using the hill for sand baths and a ruffed grouse went running across the road in front of us.  She was trying to look injured so she may have a nest somewhere nearby.
08/07/2016,The bluejays- chick-a-dees- nuthatches and finches are busy at the feeder and the hummingbirds fight over the sugar water.  There are 25 geese on the lake.  The front yard is clay and so hard that when we dig out a rock the hole fills with water and it stays until it evaporates.  The green frogs seem to be very happy about this and use the holes as their own private ponds.
08/17/2016,The loon was on the lake.  They didn't nest here this year but one loon still feeds here.  A turtle was on the dock that the loons nest on and this morning there were 2 otters on that dock.  A mallard was sleeping in the bay this morning while we were cleaning the pontoon boat.
08/22/2016,The neighbors said there is a large black bear around the lake.  We have not seen it but the scat it left in our yard was enormous.  It measured about 8 inches across and 3-4 inches high.  The heron found the frog pond in the front yard.  I didn't see if it got any.  There were still 5 frogs in the pond the next time I looked.  
04/17/2017,There were 3 hooded mergansers on the lake today- 2 males and 1 female.  A merganser may be nesting in the wood duck box.  We have seen her fly out a few times.  April 13- 2017 was the first time we saw her fly out of the nest so we will watch for her some more and if she seems to be nesting there we will check for the date the chicks may hatch and come out of the box.
05/24/2017,We have had some interesting birds at our feeders on the deck.  Last winter we had 80 American Goldfinches eating sunflower seeds one day.  After that they were gone.  I assume they moved farther south and we didn't see them again until spring.  We have 3 Rose breasted grouse beak "couples" that come to the feeders.  They like the suet and can go through a lot in a day.  We had 2 Baltimore Orioles for a while but I have not seen them lately.  There is a mallard couple that waddle up the yard to clean up any left over bird seed and corn.  On 5/24/17 we had a Red-bellied woodpecker at the suet feeder.  When he flew to a tree a blue jay flew next to him and he chased the blue jay away.  I guess the bully found out how it feels to be bullied.  We think the loon laid an egg on the 26th.  They have been on the nest almost constantly so we cannot see the egg or eggs but we will keep watch.  


06/02/2017,The loons are still sitting on the nest.  They were very late getting started so this may be a second effort.  They may have tried on another part of the lake and then we had a lot of rain and the water was really high so the nest may have been flooded.  The raft has the advantage of staying above the water unless it is extremely windy or the water is really high- as it was last year when the wind and rains pushed it up onto the shore and the egg was broken.  
The jack-in-the-pulpit is up and we found a Catesby's Trillium along the driveway.  This is a new one for us.  There is only one so we will watch for it to go to seed and see what happens next year.
06/09/2017,The loons are still on the nest.  Last week we saw a pileated woodpecker and last night there was a flying squirrel on the deck - probably at the bird feeder there.  I found more blue-eyed grass in the yard so I will watch when I mow and use the weed wacker.  The dragonflies and damselflies are busy down by the lake and we saw some big frogs when we went to do the secchi reading.
07/03/2017,The loon chick is starting to go underwater.  The family spends most of the time on the south side of the lake.  One parent still leaves at night and comes back in the morning and then the other one leaves.  I assume it's because our lake is so small it doesn't have enough food for the birds.
07/16/2017,The loons are no longer on the lake.  After the noise and congestion on the lake for the holiday I am not surprised.  I hope they took the chick to Pine Lake but I don't know if they could get through the culvert this year because the water is lower.  We have flying squirrels that come to the deck at night and clean up what the birds leave in the bird feeders.  We had a doe and spotted fawn in the yard this week.  While the doe was eating leaves from the bushes the fawn was running and jumping around in the yard.
07/27/2017,It's a beautiful- sunny day.  When we were out on the lake an eagle was soaring overhead.  On the 22nd I saw a painted turtle get hit on the road so Kurt took it to the Northwoods Wildlife Center.  When I called today they said it is fixed up and they are waiting for the shell to heal.  
07/31/2017,The orange day lilies are blooming and we are planting some bee balm for the butterflies. The orange day lilies are blooming and we planted bee balm for the butterflies.
08/12/2017,The "frog Pond" in the front of the house has 23 frogs in it today.  
08/20/2017,It's a sunny- windy day.  The lake has been very quiet but next weekend will be busy I'll bet.  We will be gone so we will miss all the hubbub and noise.  
09/13/2017,It is sunny- about 80 degrees and there is a light breeze from the south.  The leaves are turning and we have some beautiful red and orange colors.  I will be watching the sunset to see how the fires in the west color our skies.  We saw a garter snake today  along the house.  He was very shy and went to hide in the rocks around the garden.  Hopefully he will eat the bugs before they eat my flowers.
05/14/2018,Ice off was 5/4/18 and the loons arrived 5/6/18.  The vegetation on the raft is pretty dry and the bush on it doesn't offer much shade or cover.  Perhaps it will get greener and bigger this summer.  The geese and the otter also check out the raft.  We have a fox with no tail that cuts through our yard and we have pictures of him with a grouse in his mouth on the DNR trail cam.  
05/19/2018,It's 70 degrees but overcast.  The loons have been working on the nest but have not laid any eggs yet.  A tom turkey was on the hill behind the house.  He showed up on the game camera.  It looked like something went past the camera but not in the picture before the tom went through.  There are 2 hens that go through the yard so it may have been one of them. 
05/28/2018,The loons have been very diligent about staying on the nest- even with wind- rain and 90 degree weather.  I found some blue eyed grass- jack in the pulpit and one pink lady's slipper growing in the yard.  I am trying to move the blue eyed grass into the garden so it doesn't get mowed every week.  I have not seen Stubby lately but there are deer- turkey and fox tracks in the dirt that softens after the rain.  A mallard couple also come through the yard some days and there are green frogs and toads in the "water feature" in the yard.
07/15/2018,Partly cloudy.   87 degrees.
08/07/2018,We saw pictures of a bear on the Snapshot camera that is mounted on the Bayfield electric lines right of way.  We have not seen it in person.  
08/26/2018,It is sunny and 82 degrees out.  Last night some of the painted turtles hatched.  We saw one heading into the lake and found some shells by the nest.  Hopefully they made it to the lake.  It is a long hike for a little turtle.  
10/02/2018,It's windy and overcast.  When we finish this secchi reading we will put the pontoon away.   It's windy and overcast.  When we finish this secchi reading we will put the pontoon away.  It's about 67 degrees.
05/06/2019,The loons checked us out as we rowed out to the deep hole.  Yesterday 3 male woodducks were in the yard and a mallard couple stop by frequently.  One of the grackles that come to the yard has a white head.  It looks strange with all the others being so dark.  It is partly cloudy today-  50 degrees and breezy.
06/15/2019,It's 70 degrees- sunny with a northeast wind.  There are a lot of tadpoles in the shallow water by the dock.  The loons are on the nest again (we thought they left when the black flies were out).  2 turtles laid eggs in the dirt by the strawberries. It is 70 degrees- sunny- with a northeast wind.  The temp at the top of the water is 69.8 degrees.  There are a lot of tadpoles in the shallow water by the dock.  Two turtles laid eggs in the dirt by the wild strawberries.  The loons are back on the nest.  We thought they left when the black flies were out.
06/23/2019,It is overcast and rain is expected for today.  It is about 66 degrees- very comfortable.  The loons hatched two chicks- one on June 16th (Father's Day) and one on the 17th.  On June 18th- Steve Sash- the Loon Ranger from Pine Lake came to tell us we had "lost our loons."  The female loon and the 2 chicks walked (yes walked) from Little Pine Lake- through a yard and a driveway- across Little Pine Rd- through a driveway and a yard and into Pine Lake.  His wife has a video of it on her phone.  I believe it was the female loon because there were no bands on her legs that I could see.  The male loon that nests on Little Pine Lake has colored bands.  Later that day we could see two loons in the bay across the lake from where they went in- but would not see the chicks because it was too far away from the shore we were watching from.
07/22/2019,It's 75 degrees- sunny but windy.  There are 16 geese on the neighbors lawn.  We took a boat ride on Pine Lake and saw 2 adult loons with 2 chicks.  The chicks look about 4 weeks old which is how old the chicks from our lake would be.

09/24/2019,Sunny day 61 degrees.  
05/16/2020,It's 68 degrees and overcast.  The ice was off the lake on 4/24/2020 and the loons arrived 2 days later to check out the raft they nest on.   They now  have 2 eggs on the nest.   They are having a hard time with the black flies.  The flies have been bad for a few days.  There are 2 Tom turkeys that strut around the yard all puffed up.  We have not seen the females lately so I think they are sitting on nests.  We have seen one roost in a tree by the driveway.  I didn't realize how high up they go to roost.  There are about 5 rose breasted grosbeaks that come to the feeders.  I put out an orange for them but they prefer the suet and sunflower seeds.  Two Baltimore orioles are here too.  It looks like someone put a musky in the lake.  I hope someone catches and takes it out before the chicks hatch.  We have not seen the wood ducks for a few days so maybe they are nesting also.  One of our wood duck boxes has flying squirrels in it.  We still have a snow in the yard where it was piled up when we shoveled. 
05/24/2020,The loons are off the nest.  The black flies are too thick.  I even saw one of the loons beat his wings against the water and swimming upside down.  I assume it was to get the flies off.  The hummingbirds are back.
06/02/2020,It is 75 degrees and overcast today.  The loons are back on the nest and I think they have 2 eggs.  There are tadpoles in the shallow water by the dock.  The wintergreen in the yard has berries and the strawberries have flowers.  The blue-eyed grass is blooming also.  We saw 6 adult geese with 18 gooselings. We also saw a northern parula and a swamp sparrow.  The flying squirrel is back and eating the sunflower seeds from the bird feeders on the deck.  
06/25/2020,The loons left the nest because of the black flies but came back and laid 2 more eggs.  Then on 6/16 only one of the loons was on the nest.  It kept calling all day but the other loon didn't show up.  The next morning it was calling again but when the other loon didn't show up by noon the loon left.

06/27/2020,It's sunny with a light wind.  Lots of little bass in the shallows.  Also- 6 adult geese and 18 gooselings.
07/25/2020,We have 2 mallard families that come up on shore.  They both have 7 young ones.  The two turkeys that come through the yard always watch them carefully.  Lately we have had a lot of finches and the hummingbirds squabble over the feeder.  A few mornings ago- at about 5 AM we saw a large black bear cut through the yard.  
08/20/2020,It is overcast and slightly windy today and about 80 degrees.  The ducks are making use of the turtle log and the loon raft.  We had a heron come up onto the dock but the 2 toms wouldn't let it come into the yard.
08/20/2020,It is overcast and windy and about 80 degrees today.  The ducks are using the turtle log and the loon raft.  We had a heron come onto the dock but the toms wouldn't let it come into the yard.
