10/09/2004,A big change for the better.  The lake looks good.  However- the weeds in the shallows have been covered with some sort of green material.    
11/08/2004,The lake looks good.  There is ice around the edge of the lake today which goes out about a foot from the shore.  This will be the last reading for 2004.    
04/15/2005,The ice went out on April 10th.  The first loon seen was April 13th.  The water has limited visibility and is not a light green but what I think is a light yellow.    
04/25/2005,A water sample was taken and submitted to the U. of WI today.  There is a pair of territorial loons hanging around the island.  The visibility is still somewhat low and the color is yellowish.  Water temp. at one foot was 51 degrees F    
05/16/2005,It has been raining for a week.  The loons started nesting the first week in May.  I had to move the site to the deepest part of the lake so I would not "bottom out" the disk.    
06/07/2005,Loons off nest May 31st.  No chicks- no broken shells or eggs at the nest.  Mayflies in large numbers at end of May.  Dragon flies emerging first week in June.  Bass and Bluegills now on nests.    
07/09/2005,There are just a few puffy clouds so this should help with the satellite overflight today.  The lake looks good.  However- I am going from a light green color to yellow.    
07/24/2005,Tomorrow will be rainy so I am not going to wait for the satellite.  The water color is between green and yellow.  I wish there was a 6.5 on the Custer Color Strip.  The lake is lonesome without Loon chicks this year.    
08/10/2005,Clear- blue skies and satellite flyover day.  The water looks good but it is at record low levels.  My father said he could walk in front of the "Big Rock" once in his life without getting his feet wet (1914-2001).  That was in the drought of the 1930's.  You can do that now.    
09/03/2005,The lake looks very good.  It is totally different than a year ago.  I am surprised we only have 10.5 feet.  It looks clearer than that.  Again- we are between #6 + #7 on the Custer Color Strip.    
10/08/2005,The lake is gin clear.  There continues to be some color but it is fabulous.    
11/14/2005,I had to break through about 20 feet of ice to get to the lake for the reading and to take a water sample.  This will be the last reading of the year.  We had a rain storm and blizzard the day before the reading.  The surface water temperature was 40 degrees F.    
04/16/2006,The ice went out on April 11th and the first loons came April 14th.  The color of the water is seven on the Custer Color Strip - yellow pea soup color.
05/02/2006,It has been raining slightly for about four days.  But the total amount is less than an inch. There is no water flowing from Samoset to Wilipyro.  The loons are not nesting yet.  Greater yellowlegs were vocalizing on the lake last evening.
05/16/2006,This is the fist sunny day after a week of rain totaling about 2.0 inches.  I watched an eagle attack a pair of loons today for about 15 minutes.  I will assume the loons are not on the nest.  Custer Color Strip #6
05/23/2006,This is the first warm day with 81 degrees.  We are taking the first water chemistry readings ever with Dave Blumer of the DNR as our teacher.  Joe Brady- Wendy Hannaman and Roger Dreher are being trained.  We believe the loons won't nest this year.  We were in about 26 feet of water.  The lake may be slightly deeper than previously believed.
06/10/2006,It was very windy and sunny.  It should be a good day to do this in conjunction with the satellite.  The dragon fly hatch seems to be over.  No loon nesting.  I have seen four goslings with the two adults.
06/15/2006,The weather is breezy and overcast.  The lake is down about four inches since ice out and no significant rain for over three weeks.  The color is Color Chart No. 6.
06/26/2006,It is satellite day and not a cloud in the sky.  We have two pair of geese with three and four youg respectfully.  I believe this is the second time they have nested on the lake.  Almost no duck nesting success.  I saw one mallard with three and no nesting loons.
07/13/2006,It is the day after the satellite but the data should be good.  There is a hazy quality to the atmosphere but sunny and it is very warm and humid.  The lake continues to go down without rain.  I am certain we are at least at 100 year lows from what my dad told me.  The lake is looking very summery with more particles in the water.
07/21/2006,It is overcast today and the day after the satellite.  We will use our Vexlar fathometer next time.  We missed our deep spot.  The depth profiles were taken.
08/18/2006,We have broken clouds.  A fathometer was used and there are 23 feet of water.  There were six inches of rain three weeks ago and nothing since.  I haven't seen a loon in many weeks.
09/06/2006,It was a beautiful- cloudless sky on satellite day.  The lake looks like very late summer.  There is a hint of leaves changing colors.  The color strip number was #7 -  a very yellow color.
09/24/2006,It is a beautiful- sunny day after three days of rain and a total of about one inch.  Lakes remain at record lows.  Fall colors are full and no loons are to be seen.  The Custer Color Strip was a very yellow #7.
10/15/2006,The lake looked clearer than the disk reading.  I am surprised that the lake is so yellow so late in the year.  There hasn't been a loon on the lake in months.  I saw the first beaver I have seen all summer.
05/04/2007,Wilipyro continues to be at record lows and it is going down very fast with no Spring flow from Samoset.  I could only find 22 feet of water.  The ice went out on Wilipyro and Samoset April 12th.
05/17/2007,I have never seen the water clearer.  I bottomed out and had to go to a slightly deeper spot.  And with that I only had 0.5 feet under the disk.  The lake is now only 21 to 22 feet deep and we had over 20 feet of visibility.   
06/06/2007,The lake is very low.  The Loons have nested on the west side of the island and were first seen on the nest Memorial weekend.  The bluegills and bass were on the nests the first week in June.  There are major dragnfly hatches but mayfly hatches were almost nonexistant.   
06/16/2007,Clear as a bell in the sky.  We are waiting for the loon chicks to be born.  There was 0.10 inches of rain last night.  But again- the water continues to go down and down.   
06/28/2007,It is a beautiful- sunny day.  We have a pair of Loons and one of two chicks has survived.  The Loons nested on the island and the chicks were hatched on or about June 15th.  The lake looks very good but the levels continue to drop.   
07/13/2007,There were nine Loons together on Wilipyro this morning.  It is overcast but wind and rain has kept me from doing a reading lfor several days.  The rain totals are only about 0.10 inches.  
07/23/2007,Cloudy day. We observed the Loon chick and both parents.  The chick is really growing.  Lake is at record low levels and dropping.  
08/06/2007,Wilipyro is at what is believed the lowest level since people of European decent have seen the lake.  This comes from people who originally settled the lake told their stories and are now deceased.  The Loon was there with the chick which now has white feathers on its chest.  It is mostly sunny and calm.  
08/26/2007,The Loon chick was alone today and attempted to fly but wasn't strong enough.  It was joined by an adult later in the day.  The lake is at record lows.  I can't find 21 feet of water any more.   
09/08/2007,The Loons are gone.  I will guess it was September 1st.  The lake is very- very low and continues to go down.  
09/28/2007,A great Fall day!  The lake has globs of green alga and while we have had some rain- the lake remains very low.    
10/14/2007,Wilipyro has come up some but is still very- very low.  The water looks very good but does show yellow when the disk is dropped.  About 30 geese are using the lake as a safe haven.
10/24/2007,This is the last reading for this year.  It looks like the lake lost about three inches this year.  Thank the Lord for a record wet September after three years of drought.  

The lake looks good but with some yellow color with the secchi.

See you at ice-out in 2008.  
05/05/2008,The ice went out of Wilipyro on May 1st.  The truth is the Loons were around from April 28th.  There was 30 to 36 inches of ice on the lake this winter.  We have Mallards and Canadian geese at this time.  It is a sunny and beautiful day.  The lake is up about three inches from last fall.  
05/18/2008,It is very cool and breezy.  The sky is overcast so it is not the best for a Secchi reading.  I only see one loon so I will assume the other is on a nest but I haven't found it.  Barn and tree swallows are eating bugs.  
05/31/2008,It is rather overcast.  The loon is on the nest at the island. 
06/15/2008,There is sun but it is windy.  We had about 2.2 inches of rain three nights ago so the lake is up some but nothing dramatic.  There are two Loons swimming around so I will assume they didn't renest after the eagles drove them off their nest on June third.   
06/30/2008,What a beautiful day.  The lake is getting that "summer" look and there is a lot of pollen on the water surface.  The fish spawned about two weeks late this year.  Water levels are up about five inches since the ice went out.   
07/14/2008,What a great day.  There are a few mallards around but no Loons or geese.  The lake is looking very summery and has become somewhat murky.
07/28/2008,The Loons abandoned their second nesting attempt which is probably a good thing at this late date.  There was one egg in the nest.  The lake is a little murky now and smells like a summer lake.  The amount of pond weed is way down this year.  But- there is still plenty!
08/16/2008,There is a little wind.  An eagle just flew over.  The lake is now going down and we are exactly where we were when the ice went out in April.  
08/29/2008,There was a loon on the lake.  The water looks good but the color is really yellow.

There was a boat on the lake with an outboard and it was from Minnesota and seemed to be coming in and out of the condo.  I hope he cleaned his boat well.   
09/14/2008,It was overcast but it gave a very good light for seeing.  The lake was toatally calm.  We have had 2.5" of rain in about the last five days and we are at the exact same elevation as when the ice went out in April.  The water looks a little murky but the reading was about the same.  
09/28/2008,The colors are almost full.  The water clarity is down a bit but still OK.  There were two swans swimming around on the lake - an unusual visitor.  
10/17/2008,The lake has some algae floating around in it but looks very good.  It still has that summer look and is at the exact same level as when the ice went out in April.  
10/31/2008,There really isn't that much light at this time of the day.  The color of the water is better with much of the yellow gone.  This is the last reading of the year.  I will pull the boat and dock this afternoon.  
05/01/2009,It is sunny but cold and windy.  There are a lot of ducks hanging around this year.  We put in a loon nesting platform but don't know if it will be used.  Also- this winter there were 106 trees put in the lake in 18 bundles for fish habitat.
05/17/2009,A Cool and dark day.  Loons are on their nest as are the geese.   
06/01/2009,A very nice day but windy.  Waiting for loon chicks.  Their are two eggs.
06/12/2009,There is one Loon chick- four goslings and a mallard with five.  It is a perfect day to do this.   
07/01/2009,Water looks good.  We have geese with four goslings- one Loon chick and a Mallard with three.  The tree bundles put in this winter are amazing.  The fish and wildlife love them.    
07/12/2009,There were three loons on the lake.  I thought one was the chick and had really grown.  It was three adults and I will assume the two males present were the two that put on the big display all around the boat.  They have some real cool moves.  It is truely a beautiful day.  
07/26/2009,The Goslings now have full adult color.  The Loon chick is getting large and has a white breast .  Only one parent stays with it at a time now.  The lake is looking very "summery".
08/14/2009,I saw the adult Loon but not the chick which was present the day before.  Nice day and the water looks good but is so low.  
08/28/2009,Great day.  There is a small amount of algae along the shore line.  We are getting some rain but not enough to help the lake.  I haven't looked for the Loons.   
09/10/2009,I have lost track of the loons.  The lake is at levels so low that I dought that a white man has ever seen anything like this.  
10/02/2009,We have seven Trumpeter swans on the lake.  There are two adults with bands and five immatures.  
10/16/2009,The lake level remains at a record low.  The lake was visited by six swans.  There were four cignets (sp) and two adults.  Both adults had neck bands which were photographed by Wendy Hannamen and reported to the researchers.  
04/09/2010,The ice went out on March 29th.  This is the first day with a loon.  We have a large flock of Common merganzers this year - beautiful.
04/20/2010,The water has changed a lot in 11 days.  We have nesting geese on the island and at least two more pair hanging around.  Swans visited for a few days and I haven't seen the loons the last couple of days.  I need to check for a nest.  
04/30/2010,There are two swans on the lake that have been hanging around for a week.  . I  don't see the loons so they may be on the nest.  There seems to be a lot of mallards this year.
05/11/2010,We have nesting geese and loons.  The loons used the artificial platform for the first time.  The water looks kind of murky and yellow for this time of the year.
05/20/2010,Lots of life on the lake.  Mallards- geese- swans- beavers and more are all here now.    
05/31/2010,The loon is still on the nest and the swans are gone.  What a perfect Memorial Day
06/14/2010,Things went well.  The Loon chicks are really cute on mom's back.  The day is overcast and a little windy.
06/29/2010,The lake is starting to look like summer.  The loon still has two chicks.
07/16/2010,There are still two loon chicks.  The lake is windy so I started a little early.
07/30/2010,The lake is low and the weeds are everywhere.  The lake looks like late summer.  We still have two loon chicks who are now diving and will be two months old in a week.    
08/10/2010,The lake is really getting green and murky.  We still have both loon chicks.  The water level is holding its own this summer.  We had a 1.6 inch rain Friday night.
08/17/2010,The two loon chicks are almost as big as the parent.  As I was working they- swam up behind the boat and the adult loon let out a big loon sound about ten feet behind me and I almost fell overboard.
09/10/2010,Wilipyro looks terrible.  There is a lot of algae and the weeds are in all but the very deepest water.  
09/22/2010,The lake is clearing up and we have had some rain.  This is the first break in the drought in 12 years.  
10/07/2010,We have two swans on the lake.  The weather is perfect.  
10/23/2010,We had a good stoirm and the lake came up 5 1/2 inches!  We are about 6 3/4 inches higher nthan this time last year.
11/01/2010,This will be the last reading for the year.  
04/18/2011,Wilipyro is up 13 inches from last fall.  Water is a bit dirty.  Tha "fish sticks" look a lot better now.  
05/08/2011,A little windy.  There are two swans on the lake and the Loons are on the platform nest site.
05/19/2011,Water is starting to cleatr up.
06/04/2011,We aren't getting our normal clarity.  The weeds are up and the bass are on their beds.
06/12/2011,There are no Loons on Wilipyro.  
06/29/2011,Nice Day
07/16/2011,A loon made a great landing.  No chicks this year. 
07/29/2011,There are lots of weeds.  
08/14/2011,The water is very yellow.  There is some fog which is cutting the light a bit.
08/30/2011,The Loons are around only now and then.  There is some color on the trees.  It is warm but the days are getting shorter and we can feel Fall.
09/23/2011,The water is kind of dark.  It has gone from yellow to almost a brown.  Fall colors are starting.
10/20/2011,Wilipyro looks good.  The water levels have held the gains of the summer.
03/31/2012,It was a cold- foggy- yuky day.  
04/11/2012,The water doesn't look good.  It has a brown color.
04/22/2012,Ther are two loons but they don't seem to be nesting yet. 
05/08/2012,Man- the lake really cleared up.  It looks great.  I would say the lake is up two inches. There has been a huge insect hatch and lots of pollen.  The leaves have started out and the warblers arrived about three days ago.
05/21/2012,The lake is looking very good.  Mayflies are starting which is very early for them.
06/04/2012,
The lake is looking more like summer.  As of June 3rd- we have two Loon chicks.  Wilipyro Creek is now flowing to the left front after leaving the culvert pipe.  It has always been to the right front.  I will inspect to be certain it is reaching the lake. 
06/16/2012,An egle flew over and the Loons shouted- the small birds attached and the ducks got out of town.
06/30/2012,There are still two Loon chicks and they are getting big.  The lake is very active with people.
07/15/2012,There is one Loon young adult with it's mother.  The weeds are really everwhere this year.  It looks like a summer lake 
07/15/2012,There were nine Loons on the lake this morning!  I believe two are chicks that look like adults.  This is the third clarity reading in a row of 11.00.
07/31/2012,There is one Loon chick remaining.  We have had a great number of frogs this year of all kinds 
08/12/2012,  I saw mother Loon feeding baby Loon who is now adult size.  The lake is a late summer lake and visability is down a bit.  It is cloudy and no wind.
08/28/2012,Wilipyro is holding the visibility but it is full of weeds.  I didn't see the Loons.
09/14/2012,The Loobs are gone but they have shown up on Lake Hammill!
10/01/2012,The lake looks much better than it did two weeks ago.  The lake is calm- the weather sunny and the colors fantastic on the trees.
10/15/2012,The water seems a little stained.  
10/29/2012,There were six swans on Wilipyro yesterday.  Today is calm and it was 25 degrees at dawn.  This will be the last reading of the year.  The boat is turned over.
05/19/2013,We had 2.0 inches of rain yesterday.  It is overcast.  The ice went out May 10th.  A Loon took off and flew right over my head. 
06/16/2013,There has been lots of rain and we have lots of mosquitoes.  Loons are on the nest.  It is a very sunny- nice day.
07/02/2013,The water is very clear.  There were two Loon chicks born on June 26th.  A perfect day and the lakes are up.
07/14/2013,Overcast and some rain last night.  Two Loons and one chick.
08/04/2013,There are two adult Loons and one big chick.  Wilipyro Creek is not flowing from Samoset.
08/18/2013,The loon and chick are doing fine.  The chick is diving.  The lake looks very good for this time of the year.
09/21/2013,It is a typical fall day.  We are starting to see colors in the trees.
05/12/2014,Wow- the water looks strange.  It is brown.  The lake is up 18 inches from last fall.  The ice went out May 5th and the Loons arrived the same day.
05/18/2014,The lake is still brown.  The two Loons were about but I don't think they are nesting yet.
05/26/2014,There was one Loon egg in the nest as of May 18th.  Lake is still very discolored.   
06/08/2014,The two Loons are swimming around.  They were forced off their nest about May 30th by black flies.  Water is still very stained.
06/16/2014,The water still has a stain to it.  It is very windy.  I saw an eagle and two Loons are swimming around. 
06/23/2014,The Loons are around but have abandoned the second nest.
07/13/2014,I am surprised at how low the oxegen levels are below 12 feet.
08/02/2014,There was one Loon.  The water is still very stained but holding its level.
08/10/2014,There was one Loon on the lake.  Nice day.
09/17/2014,The Loons have been gone for about two weeks.  While the lake looked much clearer- the disk didn't show that.
10/10/2014,The lake looks good but we never got many feet of clarity this year.  I think it is the high water and decay.
04/25/2015,An eagle flew over.  The lake looks good.
05/19/2015,The lake is stained.  Loons are on the nest.
06/06/2015,Beautiful day.  I can hear the Loon but can't see him.
06/16/2015,There was one Loon chick observed yesterday.  It is overcast without much wind.
06/30/2015,I  see no Loons.  Water is clearing soome.
08/02/2015,The Loon is on the lake.
08/09/2015,Perfect day to do this.  The lake is down about seven inches since spring. 
09/16/2015,Beatiful day!
10/02/2015,Lots of weeds floating around.  Colors about a five.
10/22/2015,What a beautiful day!  This will be the last reading for the year.
05/06/2016,We do not have a pair of territorial Loons.  The color of the water is very brown but the lake level is really nice.
06/11/2016,There are no Loons on the lake.  Wow- is there a lot of pollen and the lake is murky.
06/28/2016,The water looks clearer but isn't!  No loons.
07/10/2016,Nothing unusual.
08/07/2016,Loons have been around but not today.  The lake continues to rise.
08/27/2016,We have lost some clarity but nothing unusual.  The water is high.
10/09/2016,Great colors.  There are still floating bogs moving around the lake.  
10/24/2016,We are seeing some flocks of blue bills (scaup) on the lake.  This will be the last data for this year.
04/25/2017,A great spring with the ice out early on April 5th.  We have swans- birds- ducks and beaver. 
05/13/2017,Cool and cloudy.  The crappies are spawning.
05/28/2017,It looks like there will be no Loon chicks.  We think they were flooded out.
06/17/2017,I  have never seen so much pollen.  There was a  territorial Loon fight and an American Bittern making noise.
07/15/2017,A little windy but a beautiful day.
07/29/2017,Wilipyro is clearing up for some reason.
08/13/2017,The water is clearing up.  There were two Loons that flew away as I rowed home.  A great morning.  
10/01/2017,I had another observer and we were within 0.25 feet of each other so we are close. 
05/26/2018,All is well.  The ice went out on May 2nd. 
06/09/2018,The Loon is nesting on the platform in the South bay.
06/25/2018,Wow- the clarity is going down.  We have Loons on the nesting platform in the South bay.
07/14/2018,I was taking readings and five Loons flew right over my head and landed on the lake.  They left in about 30 minutes and didn't seem to disturb the territorial pair.  I saw one adult with a chick.
07/28/2018,What a great day.  The lake seems to me to be weedier than ever.  There is a species well beyond the common pond weed.  When I was a boy there wasn't any pond weed in the lake!  It started over by the narrows and is now everywhere.
08/19/2018,Dave Pramann was with me for the first time.  He will be taking over the data collection for Wilipyro and Samoset.  The Loon chick made it to eight weeks so it is considered a successful nesting.  I believe it is the first one after three years of failure.  We still need a new Loon Ranger. 
09/03/2018,Beautiful day.  I wanted to see how the Loons were doing but didn't see them.  Bob Roseing caught a crappie while I was watching.
09/23/2018,It is a cold- foggy day.  I haven't seen an adult or juvenile Loon since mid September.  The visibility has gone down.  The water is about as high as I have seen it in my lifetime (74 years).
10/07/2018,We are at full color.  It is cool and cloudy.  I fell out of the boat while trying to get onto the shore.
05/04/2019,Pair loons on Lake day after iceout- nest SW Bay. Water level hundred year record high. Samoset and Wilipyro joined again at narrows. Beaver lodge far SW Bay. 
05/26/2019,Beautiful lake day- loons- bugs and bees.
06/21/2019,Two Loons on lake- windy.
07/21/2019,Partly cloudy summer morning! Fewer lily pads this year- lake still very high due to rainfalls.
08/12/2019,Very High water level all summer- fewer turtles and waterfowl than usual. Loon pair still regulars on lake but nest appears to have failed. Wilipyro still connected directly to Lake Samoset
