05/16/2005,It has been raining for a week but only a total of about two inches.  There are no signs of nesting loons.    
06/07/2005,No significant rain this week.  Bass and bluegills on their nests.  Water continues to flow into Lake Wilipyro.  Overcast with almost no wind.    
07/09/2005,There are just a few puffy clouds so this should help with the satellite pass today.  The lake looks very good.    
07/24/2005,It will rain tomorrow so I will not wait for the satellite.  There has been no significant rain in three weeks so water quality has improved.  This is the first time I have ever taken a reading and the water was colorless.
    
08/10/2005,Clear skies and satellite flyover day.  There was one-half inch of rain yesterday.  That seems to affect Samoset more than Wilipyro.    
09/04/2005,There is a slight green color to the lake.  I would think it would have more clarity than Wilipyro because it has been so dry.    
10/08/2005,There has been about five inches of rain over the last three days.  Samoset really responds to that while Wilipyro doesn't.  Why   As soon as I pushed the boat on the lake I could see this strange color almost like glacier streams in the West.    
11/14/2005,There was a skim of ice right at the shore.  The surface water temperature was 43 degrees F.  There was a rain storm and blizzard yesterday.  This will be the last reading of the 2005 year.    
04/16/2006,The ice went out on the 11th of April and the first loon was there the same day.  Lake levels are very low and there is no flow to Lake Wilipyro through the culvert.
05/02/2006,There has been a drizzle for about four days.  Yet clarity on Samoset remains good.  The loon pair is spending lots of time this spring on Samoset.
05/16/2006,The water clarity looks very good considering this is the first sunny day after a week of soft rain totaling about two inches.  Custer Color Strip #2.
05/26/2006,Color no. 2  Sunny- quiet day.
06/10/2006,Very windy but a good day to take a reading for the satellite.  There is a stone fly hatch of a type I have never seen on Wilipyro.  The loons are hanging out on Samoset.  Water levels are very constant on Samoset as Wilipyro dries up.  The color is #2 on the Custer Strip.
06/13/2006,There is a haze and it is very hot and humid.  Thee were three loons feeding on the lake and the water is beautiful.  This is one day after the satellite but the data should be usable.
06/15/2006,New home being built 20 ft OHWM.  Fawn cavorting in the N end shallows while Mom looks on.  3 loons. About 1 inch of rain in the past month.  High overcast and breezy.  Color no. 2
06/26/2006,It is satellite day and perfectly clear in the sky so I took a reading.  There is a slight breeze from the south.
07/21/2006,Three loons still here.  High overcast- 10 mph.  No rain in past month.  Color number 2.
08/18/2006,Typical algae bloom for this time of the summer.  Got rain July 25-29 totalling over 6 inches.  Virtually none since.  No loons- but could hear them over on Hammill.  Color number 6
09/06/2006,It was a perfect- cloudless day.  The lake looks like late summer and there is a hint of color change in the leaves.  No loons were seen.
09/24/2006,It is a beautiful- sunny day after three days of rain for a total of one inch.  The lake looks murky but I am not certain it is algae.  There are no loons- ducks or geese.
10/15/2006,I am surprised at how murky Samoset is this late in the year.  I gave it a #6 on the Custer Color Strip.  Kind of green.
11/04/2006,I had to break through about ten feet of ice to get to open water.  I was shocked that the visibility wasn't better.  Wilipyro is frozen over - no reading is possible.  I saw either a muskrat or beaver.  This is the last reading of the year.
05/04/2007,A very sunny day with some wind.  There is no flow through the culvert from Samoset to Wilipyro this Spring.  There has been a territorial pair of Loons on Wilipyro but they have now moved to Samoset.
05/17/2007,Beautiful- clear day with light winds.  We had 0.5 inches of rain yesterday but it doesn't seem to have discolored the water.  This may because of extreme drought and no runoff.   Loons were on the lake. 
06/06/2007,No Loons today.  The sky is somewhat overcast and the waters calm.  There was about 0.75 inches of total rain over the two previous days.  
06/16/2007,What a beautiful- sunny day.  The lakes are starting to look like summer.  It rained 0.10 inches last night. 
06/28/2007,A beautiful- sunny day with some wind from the north.  Water looks very good with no Loons on the lake.  The water level on this lake remains constant even in the many year extended drought.  
07/13/2007,There was a pair of feeding Loons on Samoset.  It was overcast and it has been raining this week but the total rain is only a trace.  
07/23/2007,It is cloudy today.  The water is starting to look like summer.  We are right on the 46 foot depth spot.
08/06/2007,Samoset looks like a lake in summer.  With the good system of springs- the lake is holding its level much  better than the other two lakes but it is still low.  There was a Loon on the lake today.  It is mostly sunny and calm.  l
08/26/2007,Samoset is low even for Samoset.  No Loons seen.  The water is an opaque green and there is zero oxygen at 35 feet.  
09/08/2007,It is a beautiful day in Northern Wisconsin.  The lake has a strange green color.
09/28/2007,Beautiful Fall day!  We have been getting some rain so the lake is up slightly but still very low.  The water looks much better now.  
10/14/2007,There was a considerable amount of alga on the shoreline.  It was partly coudy with no wind.  The lake is up some but still low.  
10/24/2007,This is the last reading of the year.  The leaves are down except for some persistant oaks.  It is going below freezing at night and there is frost in the morning.  The lakes look very clear at the shoreline but the disk shows a yellow color.   

See you at ice-out in 2008.  l
05/05/2008,Lake Samoset has regained some lake elevation but not enough to flow through the culvert pipe.  The ice went out May 1st and Loons were seen the same day.  The water is gin clear.  
05/18/2008,It is very cool and breezy.  The skies are partly cloudy and water is visibility is down becouse of 0.2 inches of rain late yesterday.  Samoset gets a little cloudy when it rains.  One loon was fishing and the tree and barn swallows are feeding on bugs.  
05/31/2008,The day is a little more overcast than we would like but the weather has been very bad with high winds and cloud cover.
06/15/2008,It is a beautiful day.  With all of the rain we have been having I am amazed that Samoset is so clear.  There is one Loon swimmign around.  
06/30/2008,The lake looks fine and water levels are up slightly.  The level is not high enough to give flow through the culvert pipe.  
07/14/2008,There is no wind and a beautiful day.  I see one Loon working the lake.  The lake is somewhat summery and getting a little murky but still very nice.  
07/28/2008,Samoset has a billion "water spiders" skating over the surface.  There are so many that they make ripples on the water in some places as they move.  We keep hoping that the lake will come up to put water through the culvert pipe but it remains just a little too low.      
08/16/2008,The lake looks very good.  There are still some "skating spiders" which aren't on Wilipyro.  A Loon landed while the readings were being taken.  
08/29/2008,There are still skating spiders on Samoset.  The lake looks very good.  Both lakes are going down because of lacki of rain.
09/14/2008,Samoset still has skating spiders!  With 2.5" of rain in the last two days- I thought Samoset would be murky but it looks good.  The level has dropped considerably in the last month or two.  I would now call it low for that lake.  
09/28/2008,The skating spiders are gone.  The lake looks very good and fall colors are just short of peak.  Two swans which were on Wilipyro flew over - what a magnificent bird.  
10/17/2008,The lake looks fine.  It still is a "summer" looking lake.  Water levels have held their own this year but remain low.  
10/31/2008,This will be the last reading of the year.  It is time to get ready for winter.  There are some ducks around but no geese.  See you next year after ice out.    
05/01/2009,It is sunny- cold and windy.  There has been about an inch of rain over the last few days.  The ice went out of the lake on April 15th and a loon showed up the same day.  
05/17/2009,It was a little overcast and windy.  Not the best day for this.  Water looks very good.
06/01/2009,I think Samoset is at its best right now.  Kind of windy.
06/12/2009,I don't know what happened but I couldn't find 40 feetof water.  I pulled the anchor several times.  I will have to reestablish the point.  

There was a mallard with eight little ones.  
07/01/2009,It was gray and overcast.  Some sprinkles throughout the day.  Water looks great!
07/12/2009,Partly cloudy beautiful day.  I ffound the spot and took a reading at 47 feet!  As I was taking the equipment to the boat- I heard a splash.  I looked up and here were two juvenile otters.  They were as interested in me as I was in them.  When I came back they were swimming under the boat and playing games with me.  Great stuff.   
07/26/2009,There was one Loon on Samoset.  It may be the missing parent from Wilipyro.  It is a great partly cloudy day and great to take a reading. 
08/14/2009,The lake looks good.  What a raspberry crop this year!
08/28/2009,Samoset looks very good.  I am concerned that the weight of the cable causes it to sink and I think the bottom is deeper than it actually is.  Next year we will take a weighted string.  
09/10/2009,The lake looks very good.  My nephew from Arizona came with me and was fascinated by the project.  That was fine until the golden retriever swam out and tried to get in the boat.  
10/02/2009,The lake looks good but is very low for that lake which maintains itself with active springs.  Colors are full but lack a bit of flash this year.  
10/16/2009,The water has changed color and looks somewhat murky.  This will be my last reading on Samoset for 2009.  See you next spring!
04/09/2010,Only 18 degrees this mrning.  It is flat calm and sunny.  The lake is low and I can't find 40 feet any more..  
04/20/2010,The water looks good and has changed in the last 11 days.  Samoset is down but holding its level much better than other area lakes.   
04/30/2010,Lake looks good.
05/11/2010,There was one lone loon who seemed to be fishing.  While the water is down it isn't like the other lakes.  The water looks very good. 
05/20/2010,T!here was one loon swimming around.  This is my first reading over 20 feet!
05/31/2010,The perfect Memorial Day.  The water remains clear but the algae can now be seen in the water.  
06/14/2010,The first ten feet from the shore are very green from alage.  Lost the anchor because of a broken rope.    
06/29/2010,A very nice day.  There is one lonesome loon swimming around.

10/20/2011,It is a cool crisp day and windy.
03/31/2012,There was a Loon that came over to investigate and swam around the boat three times.  He was only about ten feet away.  The lake is low and there is no flow to Wilipyro.
04/22/2012,The lake is looking very good but levels are down.  
05/08/2012,The lake coudn't be better.  Iwould say it has come up two inches in the last week.

06/04/2012,The lake looks good and is up just a bit.
06/16/2012,Lake levels remain the same with just a small amount going through the culvert.  The water looks good.
06/30/2012,There was a single Loon and a Merganzer with 10 ducklings.  I think the Hansons have added a pontoon boat.
07/15/2012,The lake has a very distinct bloom.  The lake looks milky and visability is way down.  
07/15/2012,The lake is covered with skating spiders   They are there just about this time every year.  Very sunny and no wind.
07/31/2012,I could immediately see that the lake had gone from clear to cloudy. We have one Loon chick remaining and always with one adult.  There have been many frogs this year.
08/28/2012,Samoset is very green.
09/14/2012,The lake continues to have a big bloom.
10/01/2012,The algae bloom is subsiding.  The lake is still a little murky but much better than two weeks ago.  
10/15/2012,This is the first time I ever thought the water was yellow on Samoset.  It may be the decay after the bloom.
10/29/2012,The lake is calm but it continues to have reduced visability from the bloom this summer.  This is the last reading this year.
05/19/2013,It is cloudy with a SE wind.  I saw an Ospery.
06/16/2013,There are two Loons on Samoset.  There is a good flow from Samoset through the culvert to Wilipyro.
