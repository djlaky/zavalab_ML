07/18/1992,Yesterday and today were the only days in July so far for swimming.  Blue herons seen over on the lake.  Fishing is poor- fish are all very small.    
07/25/1992,Clearest day I've had to take a reading- totally sunny at the time of measurement.  Surface had a light chop from the wind- but nicest "summer" day this year.    
08/01/1992,Partly sunny- hazy. Very windy and surface is choppy.

09/16/1993,I will leave Boot Lake for winter by the end of September  I expect to return June 1984.    
06/03/1994,This is the greatest depth I have measured in 8 years of testing and it should be deeper- as I could still see the disk when I came to the end of my 28.5' secchi rope.  It would have been visible to at least 30'.  I will use a longer rope.    
06/09/1994,Confirms previous reading of unused clarity.  Disc hit bottom in West Basin reading only.  That basin has deeper hole- but I couldn't find it today.    
06/16/1994,Very hot (94 degrees) + windy.  Chop on surface interfered with seeing disc as deep as if surface were calmer.    
06/22/1994,Weather moderating after several very hot days (90+) .  Readings becoming nearer to those of previous years.  Still somewhat deeper.    
07/04/1994,Public perception due to overcast cool weather.    
07/10/1994,Windy- hazy- heavy chop on water.  Has been overcast- rainy- windy for about 10 days.  Some days cold- others very hot.    
07/17/1994,This is an unusual year- starting out with greatest depth I have ever measured- decreasing in depth each reading until it is less than 3'-more than my 8 year shallowest reading.    
07/24/1994,Sun behind clouds from 2:00-3:30.  Delaying reading about 1.5 hours.  Deeper reading than previous one for 1st time this year.    
07/29/1994,Continues increase begun 7/24.  I will be unable to take reading next 2 weeks.    
08/15/1994,Warm- partly cloudy.    
08/21/1994,Sunny- warm.  Had 2 days of rain- heavy first day- this week.    
08/25/1994,Hot (84 degrees) and sunny.  Front came through at 10 pm followed by 10 minutes of 55 mph winds- than calm again.    
09/02/1994,Cool-65 degrees.  Had 2 severe wind storms (up to 50-55 mph for brief period) with some rain during past week.    
09/08/1994,Shallowest readings of year.  Some "balls" of algae floating in water- particularly in West Basin.    
09/17/1994,Floating algae gone.  Windy and cool- but beautiful fall day.    
09/28/1994,Cold- windy- overcast.  Some readings over 30' this year-please send longer rope.  Going to winter home.

06/28/1995,Rain earlier in day.  Somewhat cloudy + cooler.    
07/03/1995,Some chop-windy-cool.    
07/09/1995,Best conditions for secchi this year.  Color selections don't seem to fit.  I would call it clear/green- almost like old window glass.    
07/18/1995,Very windy-chop severe enough to affect reading (lower the number of feet disc could be seen).    
07/23/1995,Conditions nearly ideal for good secchi reading-clear- calm- warm.    
07/28/1995,Hot + windy.  Very unusual for West Basin reading to be greater than that for East Basin.    
08/22/1995,Beautiful today following week of rain and/or high wind.    
09/02/1995,Beautiful day!  Fairly heavy boat traffic- some wind.    
09/21/1995,Public perception due to unseasonally cold and overcast skies.  Water quality good but cold-temperature about 47 degrees at 1:30 P.M.

07/06/1997,Cool- windy. Boat traffic was heavy on the fourth. Secchi readings low. Temperature is unseasonable.    
07/11/1997,This reading seems more typical than last reading.
