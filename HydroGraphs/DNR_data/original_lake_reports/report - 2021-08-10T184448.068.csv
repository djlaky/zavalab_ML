07/18/2012,temp. 75.4-  mostly cloudy. calm winds. today they start harvesting weeds from the lake.
08/06/2012,bright sun. temp 81 degrees. pretty windy today and yesterday was windier. looks like the wind may have stirred up some sediment.
08/22/2012, outside temp was 75.5. bright sunny day with light wind from the southwest.could have seen secchi disc lower but got into weeds at about 7.5 to 8 feet.
05/16/2013,Light breeze and sunny. Temp 60 degrees at test time. Ice went out May1st and 2nd. Water very cloudy.
06/25/2013,Weather hot- 80 degrees already at 11 o'clock. Lake really green from  big doses of pine tree pollen falling yesterday and Sunday. Weeds seem to be growing more rapidly than usual. Large plumes appearing at the top of the water in many places.
07/16/2013,Weed harvesting starts tomorrow. Secchi reading was impaired by weeds. Could not find a spot the weeds were not laying across the top of the water.Weed growth is the worst I've seen in the eight years we've been here.
07/24/2013,Cool temps today. 63 degrees at 11 am. Weed harvesting is just finishing up. Lots of weeds floating around and blowing into shore daily. Water color very brown for a change. Probably from all the weeds being pulled up from the bottom
08/09/2013,Cool windy day . Only 59 degrees out. Water really cleared up lately. Weed harvesting was completed a few weeks ago but weeds are still growing fast. Weeds are only a foot or two below the surface in some places.
08/28/2013,Warm- calm day. Temps near 80 degrees at 9 A.M. After two days of heavy rain- 3 and 1/2 inches over both days- the lake again turned a cloudy green. A week ago I could see fish swimming 5 to 6 feet deep. Speaking of fish- last week the DNR stocked another 17-000 bass fingerlings. This on top of 17-000 last year and we were told possibly another 17-000 next year.
05/06/2014,Ice went out May 3rd and 4th. Lake water high and dirty/cloudy. A few dead fish [small] seen floating from winter kill but not many.Cold clear day temps in the low 40's
06/16/2014,Water very clear. Saw disc all the way till it hit bottom. Very few weeds growing so far. Most places can see sandy bottom.Windy and sunny today. Temps in the low 80's.
07/21/2014,Hot sunny day. Temps to hit 90 today. No weeds at surface yet this year and we called off the weed harvesting because of no weeds. First time we have not harvested weeds in a long time. Still not much for fishing. Must have had a pretty good winter kill. There are tons and tons of small fish [minnow size] by shore. Hope they all grow up.
08/13/2014,Cool morning about 53 degrees. Partly cloudy now. Lake looks very nice. No weed harvesting this year and still virtually no weeds at the surface to be seen. Water is pretty clear and can see sand bottom in most shallow areas.
05/04/2015,Ice off April 11th and 12th. 
06/16/2015,Cool breezy day. Rain every other day for the past two weeks at least. Monitoring weed growth to determine if harvesting is needed this year. Last year[2014] we did not cut weeds. So far there does not seem to be any weed growth at all. Our cut off date for our weed guy is this Saturday June 20th so we have to make a decision or pay a penalty if we cancel later.
07/20/2015,No weeds in lake to speak of. Will be cancelling our weed harvesting for this year. Water color is unusually dark. Not really dirty just very dark colored- can only see secchi disc down to 4 feet. Maybe dark color is blocking the light and retarding weed growth?
08/26/2015,Cool-windy day. Temps below normal for several days now. EWM divers on lake beginning of August found only four small plants and removed them by the roots.No weed harvesting for the second year now. Very few weeds visible on the lake. Water color very dark green. 
06/29/2016,Water color very brown. Could only see down about 4 feet. Some blade grass weeds starting to show up near the surface but no broad leaf weeds showing yet. Have to decide if we need to harvest weeds this year.Bright sunny day temp 70 degrees.
06/27/2017,assume noon. Calm winds- 71 degrees and partly sunny.
