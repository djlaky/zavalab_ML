Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
07/17/1978,Aphanizomenom bloom.  Many 2"-3" LMB around landing.
02/19/1980,13" to 14" ice
08/15/1995,Rainfall earlier today.  Very heavy weed growth in this lake.    
08/26/1995,Weeds still very dense.  Weather has been hot + dry for several days.    
09/08/1995,Lake level very low.  Weeds very dense making it difficult to boat in many areas.  Lake smells in very weedy areas.    
09/25/1995,Public perception due to weeds.  Still very weedy.    
04/11/1996,Lake has been open for about 3 weeks.  No sign of winter kill.    
05/13/1996,Weed growth almost to surface. would not swim in it but still good for boating. beautiful day-mostly sunny.    
06/12/1996,Disk reading only about 2" shy of bottom.  Still lots of weed growth. about 30% of lake has growth to surface now. lots of rain the past 2 or so weeks.    
07/02/1996,Partly sunny today- light rain last night. overall- the lake looks pretty good. large patches of slimy growth in some areas + along shore (algae ) .    
07/15/1996,Disc about 2" off bottom. milfoil seems better. lots of algal bloom though.    
07/30/1996,Lake looks good! most of algal bloom is gone- no EM growth to the surface yet! partly sunny day.    
08/25/1996,Large blankets of algae near boat landing + at north end of lake + patches in between. beautiful partly cloudy day. very dry. milfoil is very thick now in areas.    
09/13/1996,Can't read disc due to weed growth--not clarity. very large patches of algae at both lake extremities + small patches in between. water is very clear but weeds once again are very dense.    
05/05/1997,Lake level is up.  Very windy the past few days.  Weeds have not surfaced yet so lake looks good still.  Weeds are still visible beneath the surface though.    
06/26/1997,Sunny and mild wind.  85 degrees.  Wow!!  Eurasian milfoil has declined in the main part of the lake.  It looks great.  Still heavy weed growth in east bay where weevel study was moved to.  Poor clarity though but not because of weeds.    
07/09/1997,Main part of lake still looks great.  Duckweed is speckled over the top.  Some strands of weeds still present but not bad.  Lots of particles in the water.  Today is sunny and calm.    
08/05/1997,Water is brownish yellow. sunny- 80 degrees.  Lake's weed growth is still reduced from last year- but milfoil is still present- especially in the back bay.  Aesthetically- looks good in main part of lake.    
08/10/2006,DEEP HOLE    
04/24/2007,Secchi lost in vegetation - not due to lack of water clarity. Water depth ~ 5 3/4'.
