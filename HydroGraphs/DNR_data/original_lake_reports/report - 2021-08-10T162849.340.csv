07/30/2007,Sunny- calm- no boats
08/16/2007,cloudy- rough- no boats
08/01/2012,Integrated sampler close to hitting bottom. Sample depth just short of 2 meters. YSI depths taken at 1/2 meter due to shallow water.
08/20/2012,Lake Level still low.  Only 4.5 feet of 2m integrated sampler was able to be filled. 2m integrated sampler still hitting bottom due to low lake levels.  Only able to sample 4.5 feet.
09/17/2012,Could only sample 4.5 feet of water column at deep hole because shallow
06/14/2015,Secchi rested on bottom at 6.0 feet.  2 Pelicans swimming nearby.  8 fishing boats nearby.  
06/27/2015,Water 6 feet deep.  0.5-1 inch algae strings common- some in clumps.  5 fishing boats nearby
07/17/2015,less algae than 6/27.  gentle waves from breeze.  
08/06/2015,very calm day.  water 5 feet- 9 inches deep.  no algae.   very calm day.  water 5 feet- 9 inches deep.  no algae.  
08/26/2015,no algae- cloudy- calm- water 5 feet 9 inches deep
09/21/2015,These comments related to Mud Lake but the data entered in the database are for my usual Koshkonong location- DH.  This is duplicate data for 9/21/2015 because I couldn't figure out how to edit the original data to add my comments.  
I was unable to get into Mud Lake itself because it was too shallow for my kayak.  I kayaked from Koshkonong into the stream leading from Mud Lake and took a reading in what seemed to be the deepest part of the stream.  Its GPS was 42 54 06 north and 88 54 38 west.  It is slightly upstream from the concrete supports for the old carp gates.  The Secchi clarity was greater than 1.75 feet- where the disk hit the bottom.  The Koshkonong gauge height was 6.40 feet so if I return in the spring with a gauge height of over 7 feet I should be able to get into the lake.  There was a a significant current toward Koshkonong.   


09/21/2015,slight algae- breeze from south- clear day
10/20/2015,windy today- very windy yesterday.  water low due to winter draw down but even lower yesterday.
