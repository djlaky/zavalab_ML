08/13/2005,Very windy morning/overcast    
11/05/2005,For the first time since I've been on the lake- it appears we had a major algae bloom. Hard to describe but I'll try. Very fine light green-moves through the water like smoke in the air. Does not float and rest at the surface. covering most areas 12 ft deep or less. Is this what is called- "the lake turned over"  Spoke to many elder lake residents. Some have seen it before but only a few times in past 20 years. Deeper areas like my Secchi guage location seem normal.    
06/17/2006,The algae bloom from last fall is now washing up on the north and west beaches. Very fine grayish green and very stinky.
06/24/2006,I have never seen the lake this clear. the depth was confirmed by 2 other people in the boat with me
07/15/2006,windy and wavy conditions
07/22/2006,numerous boaters already on the lake. When I choose the water color as green- it is dark green not in any way a visible algae green
07/28/2006,water was a little worked up by speedboats. It also rained most of the morning
08/12/2006,water level continues to receed. estimated depth is down 4-5 ft from nov 2004

08/10/2007,partly cloudly--heavy rain last night--moderate boat traffic
08/24/2007,This was the first reading in a fewweeks due to heavy rain on the weekends. We have had a recent frog explosion around the lake. little ones seeking refuge from the rain and looking for bugs I think.
