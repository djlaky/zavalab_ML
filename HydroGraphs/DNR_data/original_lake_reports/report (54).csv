weather sunny with light wind temp 55.
06/30/2018,you will note apparent anomalies in the water DO readings in the 15-20 ft range.  I did these readings several times and the rise in DO seems real.

Partly cloudy.  We are now two weeks away from our 12" in 3 days rain event.  Lake is still 2-4" high.  Secchi depths are still not up to par but there is no redness or muddiness in the water.  Water appears clear with a yellowish tint but lots of small visible particles of some kind in the water column.

07/20/2020,mostly sunny- a few clouds.  About 65 deg F.  Have had lots of rain here the last few weeks. About 10". Lake is about 6" higher than normal which is very unusual.  It is a Monday after a busy weekend with lots of boating so a bit more stirred up than normal.
08/04/2020,sunny and mostly calm/slight ripples
08/17/2020,light winds- partly cloudy sky.  Note that our lake level has been higher than normal most of the summer with several significant rain events from 2-7" over the last 6 weeks or so.  Even though we have an outfall on the Pike Chain the the flow over the weir is high we are still 6 or so inchs above normal.  The Sechi readings are also significantly lower this year than past years.  I note 2 or 3 new 200+hp boats on the lake plus one older jet boat all of which seems to churn up the water more than normal especially when near the shore  or when coming up on plane after entering Eagle Lake from Flynn and entering the main body of the Lake from the no wake zone connecting Eagle Lake with Twin Bear.  The water is shallow in both of these zones.  Perhaps the no wake buoys should be moved into deeper water.  I don't know if the lower sechi readings are due to the boats- the rain or something else.
