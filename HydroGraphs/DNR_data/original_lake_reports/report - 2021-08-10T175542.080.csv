06/29/2012,Lots of surface bloom....wind blown
07/24/2012,Lots of bloom....wind blown
08/12/2012,Surface Bloom 
09/05/2013,Lake has excessive amount of water meal and duck weed.   If there is no wind- the surface is completely green...wind moves it to one side.    Lake has suspended "chunks" of algae that are as big as a basketball and bright green  Lake is clear... visibility good.   Excessive amounts of milfoil and coontail.....worst in years.      
04/02/2017,Ice Out Testing..... Water Turbid        
07/27/2020,Excessive watermeal and duckweed
