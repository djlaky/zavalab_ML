07/31/2010,cloudy  Judy Sura helper water level at recent highs weed numbers still low except 
toward east end  some elodea and native milfoil  some algae globs starting to form


05/16/2011,sunny- breezy- beautiful--one man shore fishing

06/18/2011,cloudy- breezy from east
08/15/2011,Reesa Evans trained Debra D.O. monitor
04/06/2012,windy- sunny- chilly--big growth of both EWM and CLP- both at treatment growth level
06/02/2012,temp and DO only
05/14/2013,Anna Moyer of WDNR present--beautiful warm day with almost no breeze--aquatic plant growth in Fawn Lake is incredibly advanced compared to the other 8 lakes I've been on in last 10 days--EWM definitely ready to treat and is heaviest towards dam--as we went east- there were fewer big patches of EWM- but more patches of CLP--map sent to chemical applicator- Scott Provost- + Fawn District Board--milfoil sample taken for DNA testing--these plants are definitely ready to treat NOW--instructions + supplies for residue testing were given to Dave Sura last Saturday- so if treatment occurs soon- Lake District should be ready to do testing--also took sample of Lymnothamnus barbatus (I think)- pulling up a big patch
07/07/2013,significant amounts of elodea- clarity reduced
04/17/2015,sunny with slight wind--lake is very low--boat launch very slimy--air temp 78.8 F
03/22/2016,air temp in mid 40s F- about the same as the water--lots of dead algae floating on surface
