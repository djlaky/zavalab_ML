08/21/2018,The second of two significant rain events totally 7-8 inches occurred yesterday. Today is sunny and calm with warm temperature. The golf course construction on the north side of LLB continues and the loose soil and water breached the silt fence and ran south to the lake. Significant amounts of muddy water ran in from the golf course creek and the drains  in personal lots. There were many complaints. I can hear and see the construction truck attempting to move mud away from the silt fence and also move dirt into some type of a dike formation.
09/01/2018,Sunny- 80F-slight breeze. Significant rain events on Aug 17- 20- 26-27. Golf course construction underway with much loose soil. The rain events caused significant amounts of soil to wash into the lake on the NW side of LLB. As of today there is still standing muddy water between my house and the future golf course.
09/17/2018,79F almost no breeze; Slow No Wake rule still in force due to high water. No rain in the past 7 days but the lake level has not gone down yet. Significant bright green algae along the north shoreline and covering our swimming area.

06/05/2019,Sunny with some wispy clouds- light SW breeze- 68F. Lake water appears to be somewhat dirty (suspended sediment) at my shoreline on the NW corner of the lake. Yesterday we had strong SW winds all day and 2 thunderstorms passed through over night. Cottonwood dust blew around and landed on our screens.
06/17/2019,The cool and windy spring continues. Lake temps today were a bit lower the 2 weeks ago for the upper surface waters. One result of this is less boating activity on the lake.
07/03/2019,Past week was rainy - approx 3" at our shore--and there was a significant muddy water runoff for over 4 hours from the golf course construction project on June 30th.  Tomorrow is 4th of July; boating is picking up today and will be very busy for the holiday weekend.
