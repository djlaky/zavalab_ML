09/22/2015,The weather conditions for lake monitoring were overcast with a slight breeze and a temperature of approximately 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Using the bathymetric map (Figure 2)- we navigated to the approximate deep hole of the lake. Due to the unavailability of our DO meter- we were not able to take dissolved oxygen and temperature readings. At the deep hole site we obtained a Secchi disk reading and performed spiny water flea and zebra mussel veliger tows. We then went to another site to perform a second zebra mussel veliger tow.  Findings: Secchi Disk:
Lake Thompson was brown colored with low algae levels which resulted in a Secchi disk reading of 5 feet at a depth of 23 feet- recorded at the approximate deep hole location. 

After data collection- we went to three locations on the lake shore to perform an AIS presence/absence check. For the three locations of AIS presence/absence checks- we meandered the shoreline via walking- using an aquascope to eliminate the glare on the water surface. We looked through vegetation and checked under and around solid surfaces. Findings: We did not find any new invasive species during our lake monitoring. We found a few dead shells of Chinese mystery snails and a couple purple loosestrife plants at the public boat landing that have already been reported on this lake. SWF and ZM were not discovered in this waterbody.  Report by Steph Boismenue

07/25/2016,With all the rain our lake is way above normal. 
05/23/2017,Lake water levels are very high from all the rain we have had.
08/20/2019,Another nice day on our lake. We have around 35 to 40 Canadian Geese on our lake this year. Some residents don't like them as they are pooping on the lawns ! We also have  3 to 4 pairs of Loons. One pair has two babies- with mom and dad watching over.
