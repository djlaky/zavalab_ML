     This is my last season of checking the water 21 years of checking and watching for bad milfoil. I will also give up being a loon ranger that also is 21 years of checking. I went to a lot of spring work shops for water and loons  both I learned a lot and passed the information along when people ask mainly about the loons. I hope I found a resident that will take over next year I will help him get started.     Bye for now.
