Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
06/01/2008,clear- light wind
09/14/2011,Water has been extremely clear all summer. The springs have been flowing well- evidenced by the amount of water going over the spillway- even during the driest weeks. Lots of beaver activity here as usual. Nearby lodges are being maintained and increased in size.
08/10/2013,Many large (up to 12 inches x 6 inches) freshwater sponges have been seen. Photos available.

A little pine pollen on the surface of the water.
06/17/2017,Lots of pine pollen
06/13/2018,some pine pollen - not too bad
07/30/2018,lovely day; calm sind- mid 70's
