Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
07/10/1979,Migrated from EPA STORET Legacy Database- originally reported by Wisconsin DNR    
06/22/1994,Visibility down because of pine pollen.    
07/03/1994,Rather heavy weed growth at rather heavy weed growth at east end of lake.  Heavier than the average year.    
07/17/1994,More brown because of recent rains through to swamps.    
08/06/1994,Water quite brown.    
08/31/1994,Starting to clear a little.    
09/11/1994,I think the lake turned over.  Very green with pollen on algae.  Lost 2' of visibility in one week.    
10/10/1994,Large pollen grains in lake.  Last report.    
05/05/1995,Much less clear that this time last year.    
07/13/1995,Hot weather-causing algae blooms late this year.    
07/29/1995,Getting murky.    
08/28/1995,Too much rain.    
10/16/1995,See you next year!    
05/29/1996,Ice off May 10. water level 6" high because of heavy ice melt. Water very murky from fresh wash of swamp tannic acid + higher levels of water. starting to clear now. (1994-95 winter-no snow-clean water.)    
06/14/1996,Lots of pine pollen on water.    
08/28/1996,Getting very murky.    
06/26/1997,One eagle.  Severe storm night of June 24- 1997.  Scattered clouds- choppy water.    
08/11/1997,Algae forming- getting quite green.    
06/19/2000,Lake very dark this year.    
09/21/2000,Very murky- pine pollen.    
10/17/2000,Lake has turned over and is getting quite clear.    
05/04/2001,Dark Brown    
05/29/2001,dark Brown    
06/29/2001,Clearer    
07/05/2001,Clearer    
08/07/2001,Very nice. Clear to 6' since they (the DNR) took out the upstream dam.    
08/24/2001,Algae starting to clear out. This lake's clarity improved a great deal this summer since they took out the upstream dam on the Deerskin Flowage. Much less algae growth on dock ladder. Better swimming!    
05/06/2002,Dark from all the rain. Water 2" higher    
07/23/2002,Fairly clear    
08/20/2002,Observed good amount of floating weed fragments due to heavy boat traffic. Saw 2 eagles and 1 loon.    
08/24/2002,Water dark from a lot of rain    
08/27/2002,Loon and eagle sighting.    
09/01/2002,Loon and eagle sighting.    
09/18/2002,Loon and eagle sighting.  Bloom on water.    
09/25/2002,Boat traffic down.  Fisherman up.    
10/03/2002,Fairly clear. No algae this year. Upstream removal of the deerskin dam allows a lot more flow through the lake. Better water quality I think.    
10/10/2002,Unseasonably cold.    
10/15/2002,Lake cleared.    
10/28/2002,Lake cleanest since started testing.    
05/01/2003,ice out on 4-22-03
    
05/14/2003,water temp rising fishing good
    
05/29/2003,lots of boat traffic week of memorial day water temp
near 60
    
06/16/2003,Very dark this spring. Starting to clear.    
06/24/2003,fair amount of pine pollen on water. may fly hatch in
progress. Many snails in quiet areas along shore
    
07/01/2003,extreme amount of pine pollen and dead mayflies on
water surface. several cluthes of malards sighted.    
07/08/2003,Green and murky looking    
07/10/2003,heavy algae bloom/pine pollen on water
    
08/18/2003,boat traffic falling off. kids back to school soon.
secchi reading deepest of year at 6'.    
08/19/2003,Clearer than usual. The rain helped to flush out the hazy water.    
09/12/2003,turn over taking place. heavy algea bloom
    
10/16/2003,Last reading this fall. Cold and cloudy.    
10/27/2003,Results averaged for year as
follows:

secchi-5.5 feet
disolved oxygen-8 p.p.m.
nitrate=5 p.p.m.
ph-8
turbidity-40 jtu
phospate- less then 1 p.p.m    
05/19/2004,disollved oxygen 8ppm. nitrates less then 5ppm. phosphate 1-2 ppm. ph 8 . coliform negative. dto-40jtu    
06/25/2004,pine pollen in full swing; mayfly hatch starting    
07/21/2004,coliform test negative.  turbidity 40jtu.  nitrate test less then 5 ppm.  phosphate 1-2 ppm. ph 8. took water sample home to conduct tests. 1st time dissolved oxygen was not 8ppm was 4 ppm instead. Delay in testing probably a factor    
04/25/2005,Very murky. Very low reading at 4.5'. Water temp the week before were approaching 60 degrees. Pan fishing was great .Walleyes and perch are spawned out. and water temp have dropped 10 to 13 degrees    
05/15/2005,Lake has cleared somewhat since last reading.  Good walleye catches.    
06/20/2005,Worst secchi readings sice starting to collect data    
07/04/2005,Heavy boat traffic on Eagle River chain. Noticed significant fragments of Eurasian milfoil on water surface. Many jet skis and boats driving through milfoil beds. Lower then normal sechi reading 4 '    Due to boat traffic and algae bloom    
Chemistry Data:
Dissolved Oxygen: Between 4 And 8 PPM on color scale 73 % oxygen saturation at 24 celcius.Fair to good
Turbidity: 40jtu good
Nitrates: less then 5ppm good
Phosphates: between 1 + 2 ppm good
PH: 8 good
Coliform: negative    
07/11/2005,Worst Secchi readings since started collecting data       
07/15/2005,Water clarity + Secchi reading improved slightly. Lot of boat traffic. need enforcement on jet ski's with no regard to no wake areas and distance from shorelines.    
09/05/2005,Additional chemical test results as follows: Turbidity 40 JTU. Phosphate 1 PPM( very good) Nitrates 5 PPM (good to excellent) PH 7-8 (good to excellent.

After heavy boat traffic over holiday weekend a great amount of eurasian millfoil fragments around peir. People need to recognize where beds are and stay out of them    
09/26/2005,Boat traffic has slowed. Only 3 boats on whole lake this Monday 9/26/05    
04/20/2006,Ice out early on 4-13-06. Perch spawning in full swing at ice out.
05/17/2006,2 nest sites for eagles on lake this year
07/07/2006,Lake association installed 12 no wake bouys atound existing millfoil beds to prevent boat traffic from fragmenting eurasian millfoil and spreading of the same.Cost to assoc . in excess of $1700.00 plus no charge labor.Additional tests conducted: Turbidity:40 JTU- Phospate: 1ppm- Nitrate 5ppm- ph 7.
07/14/2006,calm and overcast conditions improved secchi readings by 1 foot
Lake association installed no wake bouys around heavy milfoil beds. milfoi is very heay in certain spots. waiting for a completed lake survey by northern enviromental. will decide action plan after seeing their report
09/03/2006,milfoil beds on north and east end of lake worst ever. water has good amount of algea. lake in state of turnover
