Today?s recording of Mann Lake parameters was the worst as long as I have been sampling.

As many of you know- we have been experiencing a stupendous algae bloom for the past two weeks as the lake is struggling to digest the excess nutrients.

Water clarity is at an all time low of 2 feet on the Secchi disk.  (The loon?s will have a hard time seeing fish to feed the chick- which has apparently just hatched- but we can?t find it.)

The filter paper for the chlorophyll sample was grass green.  We are also sending in a sample to test for phosphorus levels (the primary food source for algae and plants).

Temperature and pH levels are high.
Based on the temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles the fish are near the surface as evidenced by the feeding presence of eagles and ospreys. It?s very entertaining watching the show.  (It takes 12 or more unsuccessful dives/splashes to come up with a fish.). Several days ago- Mary observed an eagle that got a fish a bit too big - could not lift it- would not let go- and had to swim for shore.

There are floating islands of weeds (elodea- coontail- clasping leaf and variable pond weed).  No invasives so far!

Again there are those yucky- bubbly- slippery- unappealing yellow green mats of spyrogyra algae that are decomposing on the bottom and trapping some gasses- have floated to the surface.

Gina LaLiberte- WDNR Water Resources Manager and algae expert will be in Boulder Junction at the Community Center this Thursday- July 26 from 1 -3 P.  Join her to learn about the biology and identification of different algae...from the toxic to the non-toxic varieties.  I plan to take some Mann Lake samples in to discuss with her.

What caused this current- earlier- and more severe degradation of water quality?  First- it was a very unusual Spring.   Mann Lake is a shallow (mixed) eutrophic- headwater- drainage lake (not a spring or seepage lake due to its outlet and flushing 1.5 times per year) with a mean depth of only 5.4 feet and with a primarily soft organic bottom.  Mann Lake has the potential to mix or turn over the phosphorous trapped in the bottom sediments several times per year- largely dependent on temperature and wind conditions.  Our lake has a relatively small watershed (2-000 acres) compared to the size of the lake.  Although 80% of the shoreline is in the NHAL and undeveloped there apparently is a surplus of internally stored nutrients like phosphorus to feed our algae and plants.

What can we do?
To a large extent it?s a ?natural? aging process.  My guess is that although our lake is too shallow to stratify- we experienced some recent mixing of stored bottom nutrients.  Mann Lake has a high level of bottom total phosphorous concentrations.
Follow best management practices on our properties.
We could reopen the management plan to see if we can better understand nutrient levels (internal phosphorous cycling)- decomposing biomass- and the cause of low oxygen levels.
