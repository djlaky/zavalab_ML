08/06/2016,Partly cloudy light winds with air temperatures in the mid-70's.   Few boats on the lake.  Last rain was on Wednesday - 3 days ago.   Wetter than normal summer with higher than normal lake levels.   
06/17/2017,Both Scott Patulski and Kristine Krause were part of this monitoring effort.   Warm and partly cloudy today.  High 70's or low 80's are the peak forecast temperature.  73F air temperature at the time data was taken.   It has been a very wet spring with April- and May precipitation much above normal.  To date June has also been wetter than normal.  As a result the dam controlling level and flow through 5th Lake has been at maximum flow much of the spring.  this is pretty unusual.  Lake level remains high none the less.  Lots of standing water in wetland and flow into the lake is much above average . Warm- party cloudy- weather in high 70's or low 80's recently.   High amounts of rain in April May and June to date.   Maximum flow through the dam that controls lake levels.  Much standing water in the wetlands around the lake.  High flows into the lake streams and creeks from the wetlands.
08/23/2017,Cool temperatures- average rainfall for the month- approximately 0.58 inches of rain in the previous 24 hours.  Sunny to partly cloudy windy. Bumper crop of toads and frogs this year.
05/18/2018,Clear sunny day with temperatures in the low 70's.   Winds to 12 mph.  It is only 14 days since ice out.   Most trees are only now beginning to bud.
06/03/2018,Clear skies slight breeze very pleasant.  Normal spring weather in northern Wisconsin.
06/17/2018,We are having a very rainy period. More than 6 inches of rain have fallen in the last week based on two rain gauges in my yard.  Lake level is at an all time high - based on my living here since 2003.   
07/22/2018,Air temperatures in the upper 70's F.  Pervious 48 hours were rainy with 2.875 inches of precipitation recorded in a rain gauge on my property located on 5th Lake in Oneida County.   Prior to that period pervious 2 weeks had been dry.  Lake level is high for this time of the year none the less.
09/01/2018,Air temperatures in the mid 80's.  Mostly broken clouds.  Rain in the early morning with more forecast for this evening.   Light breezes with no chop on the water body.   Labor day weekend - lots of water craft out for the Moen Chain.   Plenty of ducks feeding for the fall trip south.
07/24/2019,Warm partly cloudy with a light breeze.  Higher than average precipitation continues in the area.  Lake levels and stream flows into the lakes remain higher than normal since ice off.
06/25/2020,Sunny to partly cloudy day.   Air temperature 78.6F.   Calm.  Rainy period for the pervious week.  Water level high for June.  Lots of new fawns in the forest.  Seems like the birth period is later than in previous years.   Fewer than normal seasonal residents this year - likely people staying in primary residence due to coronavirus concerns.
07/12/2020,Partly cloudy light breeze air temperature 75F.  Last week recorded some 4.2" of rainfall on local rain gage.
