7/3/2016,80 degrees- partly cloudy- calm.  Lake levels higher than we've seen in 18 years.  Needed to raise our dock twice.  Birch trees dying all around perimeter of lake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

9/2/2018,72 degrees- partly cloudy- breezy.  Turtles sunning themselves along the shoreline. Many large clumps of blue-green algae all along the shore :(   A 3-ft snake (fox snake?) swam alongside our dock and went into the brush on shore.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7/3/2019,85 degrees- full sun- very light breeze.  Highest water levels we have seen in 21 years.  We have had to raise our dock twice this summer already.  Water color is very dark brown- darker than we have ever noticed in the past.  Newer species of small- oval lily pads have taken over the shoreline in many places- choking out the larger- round lily pads we have always had.  They are very dense.  Mother and baby loon enjoying the warm day.  Several turtles sunning themselves along shore.  Many schools of minnows near our dock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7/12/2019,85 degrees- mostly sunny- some haze.  Water level continues to rise.  Our deck at the bottom of our stairs is nearly covered by water.  Water is still very dark brown.  Water column starts out clear but becomes murky near the bottom as the bottom sediment is churned up.  Many bluegill near dock.  Large snapping turtle swimming near our raft.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

8/10/2019,77 degrees- hazy sunshine- light breeze.  Eurasian Milfoil is getting thick in the area around the Koonz Lake public boat landing. Dock is underwater again - we have hired dock company to move it in as close to shore as possible. Deck at bottom of the stairs is 6 inches underwater.  Water still very dark brown.  Bass coloring seems dark this year as well.  Enjoyed watching the loons diving.  Mother still feeds the baby.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9/1/2019,72 degrees- partly sunny- light breeze.  More small oval lily pads.  Water levels continue to rise due to unprecedented rainfall.  Dock had been moved as far in to shore as possible and raised up as high as possible- but as of Oct. 10 it is partially underwater again.  8 foot dock poles are not long enough.  Will likely be underwater through the winter which is unfortunate.  We have never witnessed water levels rising this much on a weekly basis.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5/25/2020,82 degrees- partly sunny- light breeze- impending storms.  Both lakes brown- churned up from all of the recent rain.  Lakes at highest level we have seen in 22 years of staying here.  No shorelines anywhere- trees standing in water all along shoreline- channel between Beaulieu and Koonz lakes no longer defined.  Island on Beaulieu has completely disappeared underwater.  Also heard from full-time residents that there was a major fish die-off over the past winter due to severe decrease in water oxygen levels.  Noticed very few fish during outing - mostly small schools of minnows- a couple of bluegill- one crappie.  Several turtles were sunning themselves on partially submerged fallen trees.  Did not see loons 87 degrees- hazy sun- light breeze.  Water is brown and very churned up due to recent storms.  Pair of loons swimming and diving on both lakes.
