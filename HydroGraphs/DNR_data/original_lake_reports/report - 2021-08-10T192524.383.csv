09/23/2007,Sunny- calm- beautiful fall weather
10/16/2007,We found a dozen good-size zebra mussels on bottom of our pier wheel when we pulled it.

Bar/launch (Dooley's) closed mid summer and we noticed a substantial decrease in boat/jet ski traffic on the weekends.

Last few months the clarity of shallower water on our swimming beach area has appeared noticeably clearer.
