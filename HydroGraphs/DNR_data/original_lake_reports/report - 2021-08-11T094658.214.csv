07/01/1968,WDNR's 1978 Surface Water Resources of Washburn County states secchi reading of 10'- and states measurements were taken in July of 1968 (wch)
08/01/1976,DNR Lake map drawn August 1976 states water level is 84.00 relative to spike in power pole = 100.00 (wch)
07/21/1993,The water is greenish brown.    
01/12/1996,Bill Hoveland and John Haack set new temporary benchmarks (nails in trees) relative to original spike in pole.
