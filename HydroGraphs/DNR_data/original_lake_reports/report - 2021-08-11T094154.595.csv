Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
02/19/1980,6" ice.  Drawn down about 2.5 feet.
08/22/2000,INTEGRATED WATER COLUMN: 0 TO 6FT     
07/30/2002,MIDDLE OF BASIN- INTEGRATED WATER COLUMN     
09/17/2018,The weather was dry and sunny.  It has been dry and sunny the past several days.  The water is very brown looking.  No life in the water where I was sampling.  Very little wildlife activity;  observed a Great Blue Heron and a sea gull.  A TP sample was collected 3 feet under water.  Sample taken to WalCoMet.  
10/15/2018,Lake looked brown in color- water a little clearer- and water was much colder.  Approximately 40 sea gulls floating on the water.  No other wildlife noticed on or near the water.  on North shore a beaver had gone up on shore to cut some Aspen branches.  The same hole is monitored- but the water level is always 5.5 feet- even when the feeder streams are flooding. 
04/22/2019,WDNR Rachel Sabre assisted.  Water body # 794200.  Phosphate sample was collected and sent to State Department of Hygiene.  Lake water was turbid- had a SW wind at about 5 mph.   
06/17/2019,Weather was cloudy and calm.  Lake Comus continues to be dirty looking with no vegetation growing in the water.  
08/20/2019,Tony Vidas assisted me with Lake monitoring.  We observed a Osprey carrying a fish to a nest on top of a large light pole in a near by park.  Lake had a greenish brown appearance.  It started to rain lightly while we were doing monitoring. 
09/20/2019,Tony Vidas assisted in collecting data.  Water was very brown- but the D.O. content was about normal.  D.O. very low about 1 1/2 miles upstream by Dam Road- 2.17 mg/l D.O.  A lot of crap jumping in lake.
