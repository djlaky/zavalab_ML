Eric Evensen- DNR Trainer was with training me today; he noted EWM floatables and removed them from deep hole- middle lake and near Evergreen boat launch. Eric stated that the Evergreen channel area looked  a lot better (less EWM) than last year. Eric also informed me that Evergreen owner had used a hose method to remove EWM in 2014.  Eric Evensen also noted that some "fish sticks" were removed on SW shore near new development area.


05/23/2015,Weather: Sunny + calm; Yellowish tree pollen noted on water surface intermittently along southern shoreline;II found what appeared to be one EWM floatable  and removed it from mid-lake; I spoke with lake property owners to confirm observation that water level is lower this year than last year. Diverse dragonfly population noted. Joe Guidote assisted me today.


06/03/2015,Weather: Sunny with slight breeze. Temperature:74F ; Wildlife observed: mallard pair- numerous birds and fish. I noted what appeared to be EWM floatables near Springwater resort. Several other types of aquatic plants floating in water today- but I am not sure of the types or names of what is present.  Weather: Sunny with slight breeze.

Again- I observed many floating snails when walking in water on south shore I also found a clam- first time I've ever found a clam/ mussel at Kusel; I took pics and shared them with Christopher Kolansinski- Water Resource Specialist- WI DNR NE. Via email to me dated 7/23/18- Chris identified the snail shells as banded mystery snails. According to Chris- the clam shell was a native clam/ mussel- either a giant floater or a fragile papershell + said both are a good thing to have around. Helper: Joe Guidote.

 I kayaked entire shoreline of lake early this morning; I observed what I believe to be a combination of both native and invasive type plants. One example is what I believe is purple loosestrife on the north side of the Waushara County boat landing. Other types of invasives I may have sited were: eurasion milfoil- curly pondleaf and banded mystery snails.
