07/23/1992,Weather not good for readings the last several weeks- rainy and windy; water is clearer- is algae down due to colder weather     
08/05/1992,35 years observation-unusually clear for this time of year.  Too cold for algae bloom   rather windy day.    
08/21/1992,Somewhat windy and water choppy.  Visibility is not good.  Water continues to be cold for this time of year due to cold summer which retards micro water growth

07/03/2010,Beautiful day.....sunny and 80's
05/17/2011,The weather was beautiful.   60 degrees- full sun- wind 10-15 mph.   The loons were feeding- none were seen on their nests.   My wife- Dee Dee- was a great partner on this survey!
06/12/2011,Incredibly beautiful day!!   Low 70's- 5 mph wind- clear skies with wispy clouds.   We only observed two loons (odd) and heard one eagle and saw one (again odd).   Usually far more.   We had the best- most accurate readings.....with the relatively low boat traffic- and the superb conditions- we were able to have a stable platform to gather the readings.   My wife- Dee Dee- was super helpful.....now with doing the temp readings- it is imperative to have two folks.   ADDITIONALLY.....we recorded water temps at lower levels.   60'- 47.1- 65'- 46.7- 70'- 46.7 and 75'- 46.2
06/28/2011,Beautiful afternoon
07/22/2011,Beautiful sunny day- 84 degrees- 5-10 mph winds
08/22/2011,What a Great day!!     Temps in the high 60's.
09/07/2011,The day was BEAUTIFUL (71 degrees- light breeze from the north)!   Our loon chick is continuing "fishing" lessons from the adult.   
06/17/2012,Beautiful Day- wind 10-15 mph.   We spotted four loon chicks today- one pair and two singles.   Surface air temp was 74.
06/24/2012,Beautiful Day!!
07/31/2012,Beautiful day......light breeze (5-10 mph)......low humidity!
10/02/2012,Full sun- 55 degrees- 5 mph wind......Gorgeous!!    We counted 11 loons that were in 55 feet of water and they would dive simultaneously.....we're assuming to get fish.
05/22/2013,Heavy mist- fog- 50 degrees.   
05/29/2013,We have been experiencing cool and drab weather.   This afterrnoon the sun popped out- the sky cleared and the afternoon was BEAUTIFUL!!   We quickly decided to take a "tour" of the Lake and collect secchi and temperature readings.   We observed one loon on a nest and it'as mate never traveled more than 30 feet from the nesting site.
06/10/2013,It was 68 degrees and overcast this afternoon.   The wind was calm and it appeared to be raining in areas around us.   The Lake level is very high.   Today the contractor was treating the concentrations of Eurasian Water Milfoil .....we wish them success- just like they had last year!   We observed a loon on it's nest and the male staying very close to the small island where their nest is located.   YEA!!
09/25/2013,BEAUTIFUL Day.....many waterfowl are on the Lake during their Fall migration.   70's and light breeze.....love late September!!
06/05/2014,Terrific day- blue sky- light wind- 69 degrees and rather calm conditions.   We spotted a loon on its nest in the mid part of the Lake.   YEA!!
06/20/2014,Overcast- calm and about 62 degrees.    Saw a newly hatched loon chick on the adult's back......how cool is this!!!
06/22/2014,Beautiful day today- 70 degrees- full sun and light breeze.    We spotted a loon chick on the back of the parent.   While doing our AIS sector patrol- we saw a musky about 36 inches long.
07/02/2014,Very windy conditions- 68 degrees- blue skies
07/23/2014,Beautiful day- partly cloudy- cool....about 58 degrees.   The wind was still so we were able to collect very accurate readings.   YEA!!   There appeared to be a bloom on the Lake which reduced the clarity.
08/07/2014,Beautiful day- calm- low 70's air temp.   We saw several eagles and several loons.    Dee Dee and I were thrilled to be on the Lake today!
08/15/2014,Absolutely beautiful day- light breeze- 70 degrees- scattered clouds.    We saw out loon chick feeding; how quickly it has grown!    The Lake has a lot of white gull feathers.....they must be loosing their flight feathers.    Tons of gulls gathering on the Lake. Absolutely beautiful day- light breeze- 70 degrees- scattered clouds.    We saw out loon chick feeding; how quickly it has grown!    The Lake has a lot of white gull feathers.....they must be loosing their flight feathers.    Tons of gulls gathering on the Lake.
09/02/2014,BEAUTIFUL DAY!!    The loon chick is growing so rapidly and we saw several eagles soaring.    Air temp about 69 with the surface water temp about the same.   
09/15/2014,Crisp early fall day with winds gusting and cells of rain coming through.   Spotted three loons.
09/27/2014,Beautiful day....72 degrees- light wind- blue skies.   Our loon chick has been fitted with a radio transmitter and it seems odd to see an antenna extending about 6 inches from its backside!!   
05/28/2015,Quite windy and we have had about 1.5 inches of rain in the past five days.    Four loon pairs are nesting!    YEA!
06/08/2015,Two loon chicks are on the Lake from the small island pair.    When we raised our anchor- after doing the secchi readings and temperature readings- an old fishng line was one the anchor.   As I retrieved the line- an old musky lure appeared.   The hooks of the treble hook were wore away.   Later- while pan fishing in the Eagle Bay area- we saw a bear cub on shore.....we're sure Mom was close by.   Just another day on Tomahawk!   ;))
06/26/2015,Beautiful day- calm winds- about 80 degrees.   No unique sightings.....we did our secchi and temp readings after we surveyed our sector for EWM.
07/03/2015,The sky had a filtered sun from the large wildfires in Canada.   It was also fairly windy.   We performed our survey after the Tomahawk Lake Association's swim around Hermit Island.   There were about 25 swimmers this year.   We have three loon chicks on the Lake this year- one on the east side of Tomahawk and two that were hatched on the small island.   Our eight year old grandson has helped Dee Dee and I the past three surveys- he is a big help.
07/22/2015,What a beautiful day!!   Sunny- 74 degrees- calm winds!!    YEA!!   We got excellent and accurate readings today.....sometimes  it is a little off because of a stiff wind.
09/20/2015,It was a very windy day with the winds gusting to about 18 mph from the south.   We observed very few loons on the lake.
05/22/2016,Partly cloudy with blue sky- light wind; very nice day.  Assisted by my wife- Lyn Cote.  Wildlife spotted were loons on the water and bald eagles flying overhead.
06/03/2016,Light wind out of NW; water clarity was clear.  After reading light rain started to advance on position but was able to make it back before the rain started.
06/17/2016,Blue sky- light wind
07/01/2016,Light wind out of the NW with scattered cumulus clouds- assisted by my wife- Lyn Cote
07/16/2016,Weather partly cloudy winf out of SW with moderate waves from boat traffic and wind; skies were aing more cumulus  and it was hard to keep control of the monitoring position.  It was hard to get good Secchi reading because of the reflection from the waves. Weather was partly cloudy with increasing cloud cover and winds out of the SW.  Waves at monitoring locations were moderate caused by both boat traffic and the wind.  It was rather hard to keep the boat in one position due to the conditions.  Secchi disk readings were hard to read due to light reflections due to the wave motion.  Temperature in the low 70's and there was moderate boat traffic on the water.
07/30/2016,Partly cloudy with increasing winds 
08/15/2016,Weather clear sky with light breeze out of SW
08/31/2016,Light wind out of NW cool and clear.  A family of 5 loons were seen on the way to the deep hole site.
09/17/2016,Day is sunny and the wind out of the Northwest; boat anchored but still hard to hold position.  
09/24/2016,Sunny with scattered clouds especially to the north; wind was out of the south and there was white caps.
10/02/2016,Beautiful Day Blue sky light wind observed several bald eagles and loons.
