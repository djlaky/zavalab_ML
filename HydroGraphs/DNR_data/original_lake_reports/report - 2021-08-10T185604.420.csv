06/23/2009,Glenn collected data on June 13 at 2PM.  The sky was clouday- temperature aboutr 73* F.  Karyl is reporting this data online for the first time on June 23 at 9:40 AM.
07/05/2009,Partly cloudy- breezy from the W-NW- air temp. about 70* F- water temp about 65*F.  Some human activity on the lake-tubers and pedal boaters.  An eagle was seen roosting on the island.  Glenn's boat works great-- his grandsons were good helpers too.
07/19/2009,Finally got a decent day to get on the lake !  Cold- clouds and wind got in the way of our satellite window this time. The conditions were partly cloudy- light wind- air teemp 71*- water temp 69*.  Light scsattered tiny green algae bits (bloom  )-mainly in calmer water near shore. Jim Rosenberg was my boat pilot today.
07/22/2009,Finally a nice day during a satellite flyover window!  Partly cloudy- low 70's (air and water temps.)  Several other recreating humans were out today as well as assorted wildlife.

One other boat was on the water with us as was a single loon near the island.We hope this crazy wind brings down the last of the pine pollen-on the east shore area the water is totally coated with a thick yellow layer of the stuff.

08/26/2020,Today my other cousin Jim joined me to learn how data is collected.  Getting more family members involved all the time ! It is a cloudy- breezy humid day- seems like a front is sorta hanging over us and we're on the warmer side. Air temp is 80*F- water at surface 76*F. No other boats were out- but we saw a young muskrat swimming and this year's eagle offspring high in his tree- calling out to mom as usual.  Happily- we had Sandy Wichman's DO/Temp at depth kit today and it worked well.

The last several windy days have really stirred the water up- the first time this season it looks cloudy/murky. The colors are probably on their last few days- definitely more muted than the last 2 weeks- but still lovely. We were the only ones on the water human or wild and the "TDL Research Vessel " made it's way to the boat landing to come out for the winter.  Our season is over- thanks to the wonderful Water Quality Team for all their efforts this year.
