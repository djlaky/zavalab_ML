Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
02/09/2005,with Martin Billings--sample taken through hole in ice-covered lake      
07/07/2011,Larry M + Gil K present--lake looks green + turbid--attempts ot rake up aquatic plants revealed only dying stalks
07/07/2011,volunteers Larry Mulholland + Gil Kenning present--overcast--air temp 77.2 F--random rakes showed no live aquatic plant except at near-shore area--lake is higher since being refilled- but water is much more turbid
08/18/2011,air temp 71.4 F--Larry M + Gil K present air temp 71.4 F--Larry M + Gil K along--lake looking turbid--again tried raking up plants from middle of lake- but got only dead stalks
08/20/2013,Water is very Brown and Green No Visible weeds  Air temp 71 and sunny
04/06/2015,wind picking up--air temp 62.4 F--lake water continues to be very turbid
07/31/2015,Clear and sunny day a few floating plants water murky  temp was 85 
05/11/2016,chilly and wet with slight wind--no one out on lake--very overcast
06/13/2017,Sunny   outside temp 77  Richard Mohle and Mackenzie Murray
07/23/2017,Rich Mohle and Ed Foster did the testing.
Air temp was 72' cloudy sky
09/04/2017,tested by Ed and Roni Foster
06/20/2018,75 degrees cloudy
Richard Mohle and Mackenzie Murray
07/11/2018,air temp was 93 mostly sunny
08/21/2018,cloudy    air temp 70.1
