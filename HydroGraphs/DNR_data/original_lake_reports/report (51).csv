07/31/2004,Sunny- small waves    
08/14/2004,Sunny- calm surface.  First 3 tries disc disappeared in weeds.    
08/23/2004,Weedy- but weeds seem to settle.    
09/03/2004,Sunny- wavy.  Weeds!    
09/11/2004,Clear- sunny- small waves.  Weeds!    
09/18/2004,Lots of snails.  Sunny- small waves - recent wind breaks up weeds.  Weeds close to shore!    
09/26/2004,Sunny- some waves.  Weeds only along shoreline.    
05/08/2005,Windy- cloudy    
05/22/2005,Windy- cloudy

07/20/2005,Sunny / lots of floating- tangling weeds.  Had to dig out paddleboat from dock.    
07/30/2005,Very weedy / small particles floating in the water.    
08/13/2005,Dug paddleboat out of weeds / only 2 fishermen in last week.    
10/16/2005,Murky.  The lake is the highest I've seen it except immediately after spring thaw.    
09/09/2006,This is the lowest the lake has been since we owned the property- about 15 years. Our neighbor claims it is the lowest he's seen it in 25 years. The weeds are growing in ever increasing areas of the lake- but we did not have as much difficulty with floating/drifting masses interfering with our dock area.
06/10/2007,The lake is at the lowest level in the neighbor's 25 years on the lake.  The weeds were somewhat better this year.  While the weeds reamain spread throughout the lake- they reached close to the surface- but didn't break off in huge floating rafts.  Some fisherman reported difficulty boating- but not as many complaints as the past two years.  In addition- we were able to use our swimming all summer with a minimum of effort compared to the past 3-4 years.  The low lake level permitted us to pick up huge amounts of broken glass and crockery.  Some of this debris was noticeably old- and we wondered if it came from the CCC Camp which was located here.            
08/22/2007,Lake level extremely low.  Weeds thick near surface- but not drifting in rafts all over lake surface.
09/03/2007,Extremely low lake level.  Some weeds floating in rafts around the lake- not as bad as previous years. Fisherman leave right away.
