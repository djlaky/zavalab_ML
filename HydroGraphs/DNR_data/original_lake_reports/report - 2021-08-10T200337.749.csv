09/14/2009,mostly sunny- 78 degrees-  winds 0 to 5. over two weeks of warm weather- no rain. murky water except over in Portage Bay (by 27S) where for some reason it is pretty clear.
10/09/2009,partly cloudy- 37 degrees- n/nw wind 4mp. a couple of weeks ago- we spotted some blue/green algae in a couple of bays. We finally got about 3 inches of rain over last week end and beginning of this week. 
05/18/2010,sunny skies- calm  winds 0 to 5 from the southeast.  water looks clear except for pollen so I gave it a 2 in perception because of pollen.
06/20/2010,First chance to get back out on the lake in June for testing as the rains came in and if not raining- very windy or very overcast. Today partly sunny- calm winds. Haven't seen any baby ducks other than one family of geese.  Our wood duck nest failed this year. No sign of any activity for two weeks and then saw a mink go into the box so we went to check it out and found the nest abandon probably due too either too many merganser eggs dropped in (6) and only 3 wood duck eggs or the cracked open egg rotting full of bugs that was in the nest...   Haven't seen any baby loons or nesting of the loons in our bay. Normally a pair always nest in our bay but with the low water levels....the normal area is not a good spot any more.
06/30/2010,mostly sunny- slight breeze.. finally have a family of baby mallard ducks (7 babies) swimming around. Eagle tried to attack but was not successful. Have not seen any loon chicks.

I marked water perception as 1- it was closer to one than two......

Seems like the ducks and geese did not have as many babies as last year.
06/20/2018,Partly cloudy- light breeze. Lake is very high. surprised clarity with secchi was only 11.5. I did test 3 times. Water is looking between 1 to 2 for perception as there is some pollen going on (from pines??) I haven't seen any loon babies. Two geese families but not a lot of babies. One mallard family with 6 babies. I normally have lots of sunfish at my dock but not this year. Because of high water???

09/17/2018,lite breeze with a few gusts. mostly clear sky. 71 degrees
