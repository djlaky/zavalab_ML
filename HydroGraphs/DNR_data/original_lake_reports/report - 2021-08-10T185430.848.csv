Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
06/24/2015,Spur Lake WBIC 15771800. The majority of the lakes surface is covered in floating bogs and dense vegetation- which made it incredibly hard to navigate the canoe around the lake. In fact- we were only able to monitor about half of the shoreline.  Reported by Stephanie Boismenue  
06/19/2019,Lots of lily pads(yellow flowers) Lots of lily pad roots floating on surface. Lily pad root systems seem to go all the way to the bottom with silt.
Sunny a 74 calm winds during collection . White swan on lake. 

07/22/2019,Lots of lily pads mostly white flowered. The white swan was back again
Lily pad roots coming to the surface. Some of them measure 6 inches in diameter 
08/22/2019,Overcast and 57 degrees. Lots of lily pads. 
05/20/2020,Pair of swans on the lake this morning and lots of birds. Few ducks. 51 and sunny no wind
06/24/2020,AEB: This data was erroneously placed on the area station; I moved it to the Deep Hole (443372) May 2021.
06/24/2020,Lily pads are taking over the lake. Not a muskrat insight. So sad that they all have been trapped out- so nothing to stop or slow down the lily pad take over. This lake is turning into a bog really quick.
07/29/2020,AEB: This data was erroneously placed on the area station; I moved it to the Deep Hole (443372) May 2021.
07/29/2020,Lots and Lots of Lily Pads
08/27/2020,AEB: This data was erroneously placed on the area station; I moved it to the Deep Hole (443372) May 2021.
