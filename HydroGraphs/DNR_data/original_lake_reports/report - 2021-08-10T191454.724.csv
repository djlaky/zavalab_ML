05/29/2011,Due to Memorial Day weekend- the lake had a high volume of fast boat traffic instead of quiet fishing.  
06/20/2011,A beaver was starting a dam on the culvert going under 20 1/2 Street.  Reported it to DNR.  On June 27th it didn't appear to have an animal in it.
07/11/2011,The lake was quiet and calm- the sun was shining- I expected a better reading than 2.6
08/06/2011,The sun didn't come out until later in the day.  There was thick green algae on the stream delta and patches of blue-green algae.
05/12/2012,Weather was calm and sunny.  Adolescent Eagle stayed close to our canoe.  Saw turtle sunning in the stream.    
08/17/2012,Delta of Stream was covered with thick green slug with a little blue-green algae.
05/24/2013,It was pretty windy
06/22/2013,The north edges of the lake have started appear thick with green plants or algae.  There's a clumpy green algae that foats suspended below the water surface that is particularly unpleasant.   It was cloudly- but I needed to get the June Chemical testing completed.
07/28/2013,It was usually cold a couple days prior to my test - 50 -60 day degrees air temperature on day of testing.

08/31/2013,I attempted to take the sample on August 24th- but the winds were too strong.   
The Staples Lake stream is thick with lily pads- so thick canoeing is difficult.  This is different from past years when the purple loosestrife made canoeing difficult.
At the end of the stream I attempted to take an additional sample of a blue-greenish growth floating on the water; however the growth was a hard thick crusty matter so it could not be picked up in a bottle.
I submerged an extra sample bottle to collect the water around the crusty blue-greenish growth and sent it in as a bonus.  I need to use my last acid vial for my fall sample- so the sample may not be used.   Nevertheless- I wanted it to be observed.  The stream is an important part of the Staples lake ecosystem and it was much cleaner when the farm directly north of the lake was operating as an organic farm.   

04/28/2014,Ice out - no ice left on lake at 4:00 p.m. today.    Called in by Mike and Roxy Nowlan.
05/29/2014,We had a couple warm sunny days to heat up the water.
07/26/2014,Staples Lake and Staples Creek appeared cleaner than in other years.  
08/23/2014,It was cloudy- but I needed to take the samples anyway.   Water levels are normal for June- but high for an average August.
The water quality at the Staples Creek delta is noticeably better this year.   
11/14/2014,Early ice in - The entire lake had at least a thin layer of solid ice.  A person could walk on the ice along the shoreline.  
04/26/2015,Ice out was April 4- 2015.
05/10/2015,The wind picked up and I was unable to accurately complete the water temperatures.   Before it was too windy I was able to extract a 6 foot column of water for the Phosphorus test.  The Chlorophyl test is not required prior to May 31st.
05/26/2015,It was cloudy so the secchi disk was incorrect- but I wanted to take the water temperatures.
The last temperature reading labeled 17 feet is the muck on the bottom of the lake - per my package instructions.
06/20/2015,Sun came out late but was still high because of the long days.   The water was clear with millions of tiny green dots suspended in the water.   There was a small amount of puffy green muck floating on the top of the water on the north shore line.  The last temperature reading labeled 17 feet is the muck on the bottom of the lake - per my package instructions.
07/26/2015,This is the worst I've seen the lake.   The first 100 yards of shoreline are thick with puffy-slushy green- sometimes blue-green algae.   This was on both the south and north shores.   I will email Kris Larson pictures.
08/14/2015,Last temperature reading is bottom of the lake.
09/07/2015,Sunny and Clear
04/16/2016,It was cloudy and windy so the secchi disk reading was not accurate.  Only got a couple temperatures in before we stopped.
05/22/2016,Sunny day- high winds.   Secchi disk reading taken from a pontoon with all sides sunny and it seemed easier to see farther down.
06/26/2016,The battery was low on the water therometer- so we didn't get many tempuratures. 
08/28/2016,Calm winds- high humidity and cloudy.   There was a lot of rain the prior week.
05/07/2017,Ice Out of March 29- 2017
06/24/2017,Didn't have a working battery in the DNR temperature equipment.  Thus temperatures are from the D.O. reader with only a 12 ft cord. 
07/15/2017,DO meter reading was taken at sample site and another spot in the lake.   Both times the Disolved Oxygen went down significantly at 12 feet.
09/23/2017,Collected Dissolved Oxygen readings on Staple Lake Creek on September 24 at 9:00 a.m.
From dock midway up lake stream:  surface temperature = 67.6- DO 0.3
From culvert on north side of 20 1/2 Avenue: surface temperature = 67.1- DO = 0.4

ICE in November 11- 2017
   
03/16/2018,Took D.O readings while ice fishing- not at the deepest spot.
Staples Lake has aerators during the winter.

07/24/2018,DNR Thermometer battery died- Temperature taken with DO reader with only 12 foot cord.
Conditions were windy and tests were taken from a canoe- so it was hard to keep the DO meter cord going straight down and stay over the deep hole location.
08/14/2018,100's of dead Yellow Perch were floating on the surface the DNR started receiving reports on Sunday August 12.
   
08/16/2018,DO was tested at sunrise.   Per Alex Smith- WI DNR- "The algae switch from photosynthesis to respiration at night so they use oxygen at night. We might see even lower levels of oxygen in the early morning."
08/18/2018,Besides 100's of dead perch- some carp and northern were also found floating.  Numerous floating snail shells were observed as well.

The testing surprised us; our clarity increased significantly and our chlorophyll filter was light tan instead of the usual bright green. 
08/19/2018,Checking DO shortly after sunrise (overslept a bit).
09/30/2018,The lake is back to having a lot of green algae along the shorelines.
04/27/2019,Ice out of April 20th- but the lake had white caps from the high winds.   This testing day was cloudy.
05/05/2019,Partly cloudy
06/15/2019,Sunny and windy day
08/25/2019,There were high winds- but we wanted to take the readings when the satellite was going over the lake.    The steady temperature at every level might be due to the water being churned completely.
09/29/2019,The weather was bad- but we collect samples for Alex Smith's project regardless of the weather.    
Winds SE 11 mph and rain.   The DO and Temp was steady with the lake being churned by the wind.
04/26/2020,23 days after ice out.   Sunny and calm conditions.
07/31/2020,Blue green algae was observed by the shoreline.
