04/22/2018,I sampled the location that was used in previous years by Doug Meyer.  The latitude/longitude of this location was 44.98736111 N- -92.7552778 W (44*59'14.5" N- -92*45'19.4"). 
The "deep hole" location is listed in the DNR Lake Map as 44.984575 N- -92.74612 W which is further E and slightly further N.  All samplings after 4-22-2018 were done very close to the "deep hole" location.  This location is more centrally located in the lake- but is only 7-8 feet deep.  So the deepest D.O./temp. readings tend to be 7 ft.
05/26/2018,Air temp was 82 F.
06/10/2018,Air temp. was 77 F.
07/03/2018,Assisted by my wife (Deb) and daughter (Kirsten).  Air temp. is 75 F.
07/28/2018,The D.O. readings are very high.  I must have mis-calibrated the D.O. meter. 
08/25/2018,Air temp. was 75 F.
09/22/2018,Air temp. was 61 F.
04/09/2019,April 9 is about 9 days after "ice-off".  Official "ice-off" is difficult to determine in Lake Mallalieu because ice leaves the northern end of the lake where the Willow River enters very early; however- all the ice in the more southern end of the lake leaves significantly later.  I use the "ice-off" date when the main southern part of the lake is ice-free.  the Little Falls dam had a breach during its reconstruction 2 weeks earlier and a lot of sediment flowed into the lake. 
05/14/2019,Water was clearer than in April- one foot deeper on the Secchi measurement.  A warm day- 78 deg F!
06/07/2019,Sunny evening.  Algae floating in the shallow areas of the lake (northern end).  Water clarity is reduced from last month.
07/24/2019,Sunny
07/29/2019,Sunny- blue sky- scattered clouds.
08/25/2019,Partly cloudy- dry the past week and windy.
09/02/2019,Very Strong growth of algae in the main deep part of the lake.  This is the first month I have noticed algae throughout the water column.  The NE end of the lake did not have this green colored algae growth.
09/10/2019,The bright green algae in the water column that was noted last month is GONE.  The water now has the "normal" brown color.  Sunny day.
09/18/2019,Rained in the morning.  Partly cloudy during measurement time.
10/04/2019,Cloudy day.  The water column is clearing up now in the Fall.
10/08/2019,Sunny day
10/31/2019,Kristin Rathbun visited several days earlier and we determined that the YSI D.O. meter I have been using all summer- is not responding correctly to the D.O. (at least in slightly turbid lake water).  We changed the membrane on the YSI meter- but this still did not give values that matched the D.O. meter Kristin brought as the "control" meter.  My YSI meter reads well above saturation (i.e. about 130% of saturation).  Therefore- all the values reported this summer may be suspect.  Strangely- when I use the YSI meter to measure the D.O. in very clear water (i.e. tap water or Willow River water)- it seems to give values that are much more believable (i.e. 70-100% saturation).
07/20/2020,Hot- sunny day (83 deg. F). The last two days have been 90-95 deg. F.  Due to COVID there were no materials for collecting water samples until July.  I was gone 3 weeks in June to mid-July due to my daughter breaking her collarbone and four ribs and I had to help her out in Anchorage AK.  So this was the first measurement day of 2020.
07/27/2020,Warm.  Note the D.O. measurement are erroneous as always in the murky lake water.  The meter gives reasonable values in clear water.
08/19/2020,Some floating green/black algae blobs in the lake.
08/22/2020,More green/black blobs of floating algae in the lake.
08/24/2020,Overcast sky.  Same problem with the D.O. meter giving very high values in the murky lake water.  It gives reasonable values in clear water.
09/21/2020,There was less blue-green algae blobs floating in the lake than in the previous couple of weeks- now that it is later in the Fall.  I submitted a water sample for Phosphorous and chlorophyll as there was no Spring sample taken because of the COVID situation.  No collection materials had been sent out.

Today was sunny and warm for late Sept. (66 deg. F).  D.O. data is obviously erroneous.  The D.O. meter gives believable results in CLEAR water- but gives unbelievably high values in algae-filled lake water.  The meter seems to read correctly in tap water- in clear aquarium water and in clear Willow River water.
10/06/2020,Sunny- a few clouds.
10/26/2020,Last reading for the year.  Taking the pontoon boat out today as the overnight low was about 20 deg. F.  Clear sky- but COLD driving across the lake to the boat launch.  The water clarity is the best of the year- now that it has gotten quite cold.
