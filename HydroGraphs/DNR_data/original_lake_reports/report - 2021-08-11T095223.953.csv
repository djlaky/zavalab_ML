06/11/2007,Slightly hazy- wind ~ 5mph NE.  Surface water temp 76 F.
06/29/2007,Bright- clear- calm.  Surface water temp 80 F.
07/21/2007,Surface Water Temp  -  79 deg F.  Bright- clear- wind 0-5 mph NNE.
08/22/2007,Surface water temp  -  74 deg F.  Bright- clear- calm.  Water relatively clear- but with slight green algal tint.
09/08/2007,Hazy sun to light overcast.  Wind 0-5 var.  Surface water temp. 75 F.  The Secchi depth reading remains lower than normal- but the green algal tint is gone and has bveen replaced by a gray/brown tint which is likely a high plankton population.
09/27/2007,Bright- clear- calm.  Surface water temp  -  down to 64 deg F.  The gray/brown tint noted last month continues and the Secchi depth has not improved as it normally does later in the year.  It is perhaps wise to note that water level is EXTREMELY low ... approximately 7 feet down from just several years ago.  The lake is a seepage lake and many in this area are suffering the same fate.  
10/12/2007,Bright with light overcast- calm.  Surface water temp  -  54 deg F.  The gray/brown tint previously reported has persisted and the Secchi depth has not recovered as it usually does in the fall.  DNR sources also feel that the gray/brown is likely due to plankton.  The Secchi reading recorded is that lowest that I have seen since I have been on this site.  Lake level is still the lowest since the mid 80's according to local sources.

10/08/2008,Clear and bright- wind 0-5 westerly- surface temp 57 F.
10/18/2008,Clear and bright- wind calm.  Surface temp 53 F.  The sudden decrease in Secchi depth noted probably relates to low water.  This small (23 acre) lake has lost approx. half of its water volume and 6.5 feet in depth over the last 5-6 years.  The color of the turbidity is gray-brown and suggests plankton.  It is definitely not the green of an algae bloom.  Note: high capacity well nearby.
