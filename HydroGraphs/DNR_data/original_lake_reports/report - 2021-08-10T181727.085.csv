09/02/2008,Clear day with 5 mph breeze.  Original given lat/lon was in shallow water with heavy weed.  Moved 500 ft. North to deep water and will take future reading at this new spot which roughly corresponds to the mark indicated on the map.
09/26/2008,Cloudy and a bit breezy.  Millfoil and other weeds are starting to recede from the surface.
10/08/2008,Clear and relatively calm.  Several ducks flying but all the geese which were here all summer seem to have left.
10/14/2008,This will be last reading for the season as I am taking the pontoon boat out for winter storage.  
05/24/2009,Sunny and clear sky with a slight breeze out of the east.  Near the monitoring site one eagle was standing guard near the nest containing two young.  Several geese around but no sign of a new hatch yet.
05/30/2009,Partly cloudly- slight chop on water surface.  Some herons- geese- and gulls.
06/15/2009,Bright sunny day- slight chop on water.  Two newborn eagles still in nest.  Four adult geese with fourteen young ones.  Weed are almost to the surface and already trouble hanging up on propeller.
07/20/2009,Partly cloudy with calm waters.  Weeds are at the surface and have collected the algie for a not very nice look.  Two young eagles have been out of the nest for several weeks now and learning to hunt with parents.  Lake monitoring spot is very close to the eagle nest so it is always a treat to visit them.
08/12/2009,Clear- sunny sky and calm water.  Algae trapped on the surface in all the weedy areas.  Both young eagles seen but not the adults.
09/25/2009,Most of the surface weeds have receded and the lake appearance has greately improved.  Partly cloudy and a slight chop.  Several herons and terns spotted.
06/16/2010,Lake water clarity poor due to many days of rain.  Eagle nest which has been occupied for many years has been abandoned.   Weeds seem to be spreading every year.  
07/28/2010,Mostly sunny with calm water.  Algie and surface weeds are thicker than they have been for the 16 yrs. I lived on the flowage.   The secchi reading is also the lowest I've had in in the 3 yrs. I've been gathering the data.
09/10/2010,Partly sunny with slight ripple on water.  Most of surface weeds have finally disappeared and lake is so much nicer to the eye and nose.  Saw one eagle and several heron.
06/27/2011,Partially overcast and a bit hazy with a ripple on the water.  Weed growth seems to be 3-4 weeks late this year.  The 2 ft. Secchi reading is the lowest that I can remember.
07/19/2011,Hot- hazy- sunshine.  Lake very calm- more weeds reaching top of water- but estimate weed growth is 3-4 weeks behind normal.    Several families of geese feeding in the weeds.  No sighting of baby eagles leaving the nest yet.
08/06/2011,Partly cloudy with slight breeze.  Floating weeds and algea are clogging up north shore.  Baby eagles have been flying from the nest for approximately 3 weeks.
08/16/2011,Partly sunny and clm waters.  Algie and floating weeds starting to subside a bit along south shore.
05/15/2012,Clear and sunny with small ripples.  Weeds not to surface yet in shallow bays.
06/12/2012,Partly cloudy and breezy.  Some weeds up to surface but less than normally this time of year.  Stopped to view eagle nest but no sighting.  So far I have only seen one baby head at a time- so I don't know whether they have two chicks this year.
07/14/2012,Partly cloudy- extreemly hot with a slight breeze.   Algie has blown in to North shore and is clogged around docks with an unpleasant odor.
08/17/2012,Algie on surface finally receding- significantly improving appearance.  Sunny calm day.  Found immature eagle when it called as we motored by.  Secchi depth was greatest I remember recording at 7 ft.  Had to do it twice to be sure.  I wonder if the increasing zebra muscle population is contributing to greater clarity 
05/14/2013,Partly cloudy with slight breeze.  Very few weeds visable at the surface at this time.  One eagle head visible in the nest but without binoculars couldn't tell if adult or newborn.
06/10/2013,Overcast skies and slight breeze.  Weeds up to the surface in all shallow areas.  Seems early for such a mass of weeds given the cooler temps so far this year.  Really distracts from enjoyment of lake.  Had to stop 4 or 5 times to clean the propeller on the way out to the channel from the dock.  Two baby eagles sitting on the edge of their nest with one adult sitting in a tall tree 200 yards away.
