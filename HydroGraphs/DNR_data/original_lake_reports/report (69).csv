Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
07/09/1979,Migrated from EPA STORET Legacy Database- originally reported by Wisconsin DNR    
07/22/2015,First entry of data (collected 072215) - data entered 072315. Clear to partly cloudy- minimal wind. Sighted 1 common loon (Gavia immer) with 1 juvenile.
08/05/2015,Sunny - light wind. Loon pair active on the lake. Juvenile loon is now reaching the size of a duck and although it continues to benefit from its mother- it is active in diving and securing food on its own (but is still taking food from mother). As always- lake coloration is moderately stained (making the Seechi disk show a yellowish color).  
08/26/2015,Sunny - north wind 5-10
Water coloration at 10.5 ft. yellowish due to natural mild staining characteristic of North Twin Lake 
10/07/2015,Sunny - wind calm to 5 mph. 
05/02/2016,First data collection for 2016. Clear skies- calm wind (0-5). Common Loon pair have arrived for 2016 breeding season. 
05/18/2016,Clear- light winds. A pair of Loons are on the lake along with a pair of Trumpeter Swans. 
06/04/2016,Overcast - some algal development but minor. Water coloration is reddish/yellow which is attributable to this being a "stained" lake. lake level is higher than normal due to the recent heavy rains. The water level is approx. 5" higher than what I would call normal.
07/19/2016,Lake clarity is somewhat compromised - this is likely attributable to the recent torrential rains on July 11causing some sedimentation.  
08/16/2016,Water clarity compromised by more staining than normal- probably due to the amount of rain as it drains into the lake through surrounding bogs. 
05/14/2017,Stained Water = Red/Yellow Tint; lake Level ~ 1 ft. above "normal" 
06/04/2017,Stained Water = Red/Yellow Tint; lake Level ~1 ft. above "normal"
07/09/2017,Sunny/calm lake. Water tint is actually reddish/yellow ... not just one color. The tint seems deeper in color compared with e-g- last year. Water level still high (est. ~1 ft. above "normal". This is not likely to be a reproductive year for loons. Per observations as a Loon Ranger- water level was an issue in 2016 and water level has been remained higher in 2017. This "seems" to have limited historical nesting sites but- of course- there can be other factors. There was a pair early in the season but one or both sexes disappeared for unknown reasons. 
08/24/2017,Calm conditions - lake level still higher than normal but has been headed toward more normal levels over the last 6-8 weeks.
10/10/2017,Calm Lake - lake level still above normal due to recent autumn rain events. Since North Twin Lake is a stained drainage lake- I am assuming that the rain events of 2016/2017 has resulted in more drainage from wetlands/bogs and- therefore- the water clarity is somewhat compromised by increased tannins in the water.   
05/27/2018,Calm wind - clear sky with some high level clouds
07/23/2018,The usual degree of stain (tannins) in the water.
05/24/2019,Stained water as usual - Lake level is the highest I have seen since moving here in 2014. 
06/19/2019,Stained water as always - coloration is more of a combination of red/yellow
07/22/2019,Weather clear with light NW winds. Normal date but the trend in recent times has been toward less clarity which is likely related to heavy rains in the last 2-3 years causing more runoff and drainage from surrounding wetlands/bogs.
08/22/2019,Despite no excessive rains since last data collection- the Secchi reading has worsened
05/20/2020,Clear day- light winds. A pair of territorial loons were sighted and have been under observation since April 18. Clear weather- light winds temp low 60's.
