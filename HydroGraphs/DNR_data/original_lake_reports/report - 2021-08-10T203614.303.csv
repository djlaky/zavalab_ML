05/08/2013,with Don Laine
05/26/2013,Water color was more black than any of the color choices.
05/31/2013,Needed to wait until evening when winds calmed; water more of a black color than other choices
06/10/2013,Black color to the water
06/16/2013,Reading taken after first real busy speedboat day on the lake with lots of churning of the water; water was its usual black color; 3" of rain on one day alone during the rainy week
07/03/2013,Scattered rain showers today and yesterday
08/21/2013,Little choppy due to wind; waves made it harder to read the disk
09/25/2013,Last planned reading for 2013
06/28/2014,Completed this with the help of Don Laine; the 15' and 20' DO values seem to be backwards.  I ran the test on them twice and got the same reading so I must have reversed the bottles at some point.
08/23/2014,Observed CLP in creek that empties into the lake; same area but further upstream than the area where we pulled CLP earlier this summer.  Don Laine and I were checking to see if we need to hand-pull more CLP.
06/08/2015,Hand-pulled curly-leaf pondweed with Don and Lowell from creek west of public landing
06/13/2015,Don Laine worked with me to sample water
07/09/2015,The surface of the lake near the shore has its annual greenish-brownish streaks.  Not sure what algae bloom is but that term comes to mind.
07/18/2015,Still some spots with algae
07/30/2015,Water temp 79 degrees
10/14/2015,Temp was 58.6 at 5' deep.
12/09/2015,Water temp in shallow water very near the shore is 39.5.
05/02/2016,Checked inflowing creek near public landing to see if curly leafed pond weed is growing and there's no sign of it yet
05/27/2016,water temp 73.2
07/16/2016,Greenish hue to the water  
09/20/2016,Today follows last night's heavy rain of almost 2"
10/10/2016,Water temp = 61
09/30/2019,High temps in the 80s!!  Water level a little high because of recent heavy rains.
05/21/2020,Lake water was dark after runoff from our 3.6? rain on Sunday. 
07/21/2020,Secchi disk depth 8'
