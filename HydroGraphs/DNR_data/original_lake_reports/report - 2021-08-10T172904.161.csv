09/07/2020,This was a non-satellite day but we were out to take a sample for water chemistry and measured temperature and secchi. It was cloudy and breezy and we had had several days of high winds and below-normal temperatures. The air temperature was mid-50s and the surface water temperature (according to Michael's fish finder) was 60. We had a hard time believing our water temperature readings so we did it twice and had the same numbers both times.
09/21/2020,Weather was sunny but very windy and the surface of the lake was a little choppy. Air temperature was in the low 60's.
