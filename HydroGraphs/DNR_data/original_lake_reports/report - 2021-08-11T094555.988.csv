07/15/2007,Partly cloudy- slight wave action- temperature in low 80's.  Eagle nesting activity on east shore of Balsam Lake- as earlier reported; two young Bald Eagles- both females- approximately 10 weeks old- left the next during previous week.  There are approximately seven (7) Bald Eagles frequenting the shoreline areas of the lake.

Wind from the south at approximately 10 knots; light wave action; air temperature approximately 70 degrees.  Less than 10% cloud cover.

This is the final submission of data for Balsam Lake sites #663045 and #663150 for 2008.
05/28/2009,Same information applies as enter for site #663150.
06/11/2009,Mostly clear sky with light wind from west and minimal wave action.  Air temp is 81 degrees.  Water quality (appearance) is markedly less than two weeks earlier- with fair amount of suspended pollen particles in the water.
06/25/2009,Clear sky with less than 5% clouds; air temp at 86 degrees with light breeze from northwest and minimal wave action.  Significant improvement in water quality observed since previous readings two and four weeks ago.  The lake has lost its only eagle nest on the east shore (immediately east of public boat landing) apparently from heavy winds in late winter/early spring.  This nest was established back in the early 1980's.  No newly-built nest is visible along lake's shortline.  Fewer number of eagles- two or less- have been sighted in past month.  There is a significant reduction in the number of squirrels (gray- black + red) on our east shore property- however this has been offset by a doubling of the number of chipmunks from last year.  Several neighbors reporting similar observations.
07/13/2009,No wind; dead calm.  High cirrus clouds with air temp in mid-70's.  One of only two boats on the lake.  Sun angle still high enough for an adequate reading.
07/19/2009,See entered data for site #663150 on Balsam Lake on this date.
08/05/2009,Same information as entered for site #663150 same lake- same date.
08/20/2009,Along with data submitted on this date for site # 663150- a significant change in water clarity has been noted for both sites on Balsam Lake.  Appears to be increased levels of botom sediment suspended in the water.
