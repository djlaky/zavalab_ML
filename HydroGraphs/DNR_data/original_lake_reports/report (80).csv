Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
05/31/2019,Crystal Clear water visibility down to 13.5 feet. Very clean water
06/13/2019,Clear visibility. Surface dust- pollen- bugs- but water clarity is very high. Loons and loon eggs on nest. 
06/21/2019,Less visibility but still very clean and clear water. More boat traffic could be the reason for less visibility. 
06/29/2019,Lots of bugs (knats) on the lake surface this morning. A lot more jet ski and boat activity noted in the past week as well. Swimming near the shore line does not have the visibility it has had the last two weeks (water was cooler so have not been swimming every day) . The water is more murky with visibility only about three to four feet. Floating dust and light algea. Temperature is considerably warmer and more comfortable for swimming. Boat monitor temp reading is 82 versus 74 a week ago.
