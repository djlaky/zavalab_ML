09/15/2001,Mostly cloudy- the temperature is 60 degrees- southerly breeze- no boats present at beginning of sample- pickerel weed is taking over former bulrush areas- more submergent algae in shoreline areas than previous years- and this has been an extremely dry summer- had 4" of rains since August.    
10/12/2001,No boats on the lake- mostly clear- leaves in full color- and the temperature is 55 degrees.    
05/20/2002,Ice out April 17th- clear day- temperature 50 degrees and 22 degrees at 5:30 am.    
06/10/2002,Windy - had to steady pontoon boat.    
07/09/2002,Have had 8 day s of 90+ degree weather- water was approaching low level-  got 4 1/4" of rain on 7/8.  Today's expected high is 82 degrees.    
07/29/2002,Warmer and wetter than normal summer.  About 15 days above 90 to date. About 8" of rain in July.  Pickeral weed continues to supplant reeds in weed beds.  Brownish globs in shallows.  We used to refer to these as "dog days" in our youth.    
08/26/2002,Lake is weedier than normal- probably due to wet and
hot summer (10 days of 90 or more in July).  There is more than normal of what we called "dog days" brown-appering sediment on the surface: probably clinging to near-emergent weeds.    
10/11/2002,DEEP HOLE    
05/29/2003,November 2002 - March 2003 driest on record.    
06/30/2003,Used new water sampler received from Dave Blumer. Clear day.    
07/16/2003,Weeds- both submersed and emergent- stem less abundant this year.    
08/24/2003,Have had five 90 F or higher days since August.  Slight overcast.  Secchi difficult.    
10/04/2003,August and September driest since early 1900s.  Early October 15 degrees below normal (25-50 F).    
05/09/2004,Windy: difficult to hold anchor and shady side.  No emergent weeds. 80 degrees.  Locator depth at sampling site:20 feet.  Mother's Day. One pontoon boat ond one powerboat on the lake.    
06/27/2004,Mostly cloudy. 67 degrees. some chop. Rainy Spring but little precipitation since mid June.  Cool Spring.  Weeds at or ahead of schedule.  Eagle's nest on Falk Lake did not get blown down during mid June storm.    
07/31/2004,Fair- beautiful (73 degrees)- slight chop- making Secchi reading somewhat difficult.  Dry sice Juyly 4 but had 1" of rain on july 28 and 1/2" on July 30.    
08/10/2004,DEEPEST SPOT NEAR CENTER OF LAKE    
08/23/2004,Third coolest August on record: tenth coolest summer.  2+ inches of rain in August: 4 inches behind for the year.  8 AM temp is 55 degrees.  Breeze and sun angle make Secchi reading somewhat difficult.    
10/11/2004,Fifth warmest September on record.  September rainfall about average.  October temps above average to date.  Seventy degrees and slight overcast.  Northern Millfoil in Minerva: southwest of the entrance to Cranberry Lake and near Blueberry Hill on the southwest corner of Minerva.    
05/23/2005,Temperature 60 degrees and hazy.  Warm early spring (80 degrees in early April.  Mid April to present- temperatures have been below normal.  Dry until about mi-May.  Slightly below normal precipitation of 7.5 " to date.    
06/27/2005,Mid May to present has been very hot.  At least three days above 90 andone day the week of June 20 of 97 degrees.  Mid May to mid June the rainfall was abundant (about 5 inches).  However- in the last two weeks we have had only 0.8 inch- which fell on June 20.  This morning is warm and humid (76 degrees at 6AM): thunderstorms- with 0.3 inches of rain- form 0730 to 0930.    
07/31/2005,July had 17 days of 90 degrees or greater. Last year we had three days over 90- total. Only about 1" of rain all month. Today is hazy and windy (about 15 knots) and 80 degrees- on the way to 90 degrees. 
 July had 17 days above 90 degrees.  Last year we had 3 days total.  About 1" of rain for the entire month.Today is hazy- windy (about 15 knots) and 80 degrees- on the way to 90 degrees.

 
    
08/29/2005,Had .85 inches of rain August 24.  last tow weeks had 50s in eve3ning upper 70s to low 80s during day.  Today is 60 degrees and partly cloudy.    
10/16/2005,DEEP HOLE - INTEGRATED SAMPLE    
05/28/2006,Ice out was April 13.  Previous two years it was April 19.  2005 tied with 1998 as the warmest year on record.  We did not have a subzero date in January 2006: the first in 130 years.  Rains came in early and late April: mid April was dry.  Rains came in early May: mid May to the sampling date it has been dry.  The day after sampling (May 29) the temperature was 97 degrees.  That evening we had about 3-1/2 inches of rain.
07/04/2006,Only 1/2" of rain in June.  Also warmer than normal.  Weeds- such as pondweed- are thriving.  Slight chop and low sun- but Secchi reading is easy.
07/10/2006,Some chop but sun angle is favorable.  News just out.  First half of 2006 is the warmest on record.
07/31/2006,The first half of 2006 was the warmest half year on record.  We have had twenty one days above 90 degrees- including last seven in a row (one day above 100).  We had 2-1/2⿿ of rain in the past week:  the first measurable rain since the end of May.  We have not mowed grass since the first week of June.  Slight chop makes Secchi reading less than optimal.
08/27/2006,August has been seasonally normal.  This week in low 80s: 50-60 nights.  About 3" of rain in August.  Slight chop.  Sunny and 75 degrees.
10/15/2006,Last week was very cold: highs in the 30s and lows in the 20s.  Highs about 20 degrees below normal.  We ahve had about 2-1/2 inches of rain since the last sampling at the end of August.  Secche reading is very difficult due to the low sun angle at 5 PM (we had to wait for the lake to settle down: it has been very windy).  Today is nice.  The temp at 5 PM is about 50 degrees.
05/12/2007,Ice out was April 15.  We could not get out before the lake turned over. The winter and spring to date were very dry.  The temp is 66 degrees.  The sky  is sunny: there is some chop- making Secchi reading difficult.  Because of the early- warm spring- we note an unusual amount of brown mossy clusters- some as large a 2 feet by six feet- mostly submerged- slightly below the surface- especially in the flowage (the mile long channel from Minerva Lake to the dam).  There are so many it is difficult to navigate the channel and miss them: impossible if meeting other boats.  We have never witnessed this before.  My wife- Joan is a helper- and should get a number.
06/30/2007,June 2007 is the eighth warmest June since records were kept beginning in 1891.  We have had 11 days above 90 degrees.  It is also dry.  We are 2" below the normal June rainfall.  Today is 80 degrees with sunshine.
07/29/2007,July continues hot.  We have had 17 days at or above 90 degrees-YTD.  It has also been dry.  However- we had 4" of rain about July 20 and another 1/2" about July 26.  Today is 90 degrees and there is some chop.  Weeds are prolific this year: especially the submergent weeds such as coontail.  Pondweed is also thriving.
08/26/2007,YTD we have had 27 days at or above 90 degrees. Continues dry: but we had 3" of rain in August- which puts us within 2" of normal precipitation for the year.  It has been sporadic- with too much dry and windy weather between rains.  Today is 72 degrees- partly cloudy- with some chop.  Secchi reading is somewhat difficult.
05/24/2008,Some Chop
06/22/2008,This has been a cool spring.  Three 80 degree days this late into June has not occurred since 1945.   We had 3.75" of rain from June 9-14- but the last eight days have been dry.  It is currently 78 degrees and partly cloudy.  As has been the case all spring- there is wind: the lake has chop- but no whitecaps.
07/31/2008,July has been dry. We did get 1-1/2? in 1/2 hour on July 24.  The last three days have been 90 degrees- with 70 degree dew point.  The sky is hazy- with some chop.  Secchi reading is difficult.
08/24/2008,Dryness continues.  There has been no measureable rain since July 24.  We have had two 3-day hot spells: one in early August and the second on August 19-22 (temps 85+ and dew points 60+).  The last two days have been pleasant (70s daytime and 50s evening).  Sunny and 75 today: some chop.  

Last year we had 25 days at or above 90: this year we have had 8.  Last August saw 6 days of 90 or above: this year 0.

04/27/2009,Ice out was April 14.  In 2007 it was April 25.  In 2008 it was April 19.  April 19 is a fairly typical historical date.  Fall of 2008 was very dry.   The winter season was mixed.  In December it was colder then normal- and we had a fair amount of snow: approximately 20?.  January was normal temperature wise and below normal precipitation. February was below normal temperature wise: we had about 1/2? of rain on February 10: all the lake snow cover disappeared- but the surface refroze immediately thereafter.  March was below normal.  The temperature was below freezing the entire month: March 31 it finally reached 32 degrees.


Because the majority of the snow fell during the cold December- we had very low moisture content.  The lakes this spring are the lowest we have seen since 1993- when the lake was lowered in the fall to repair the dam.

April has been cool and dry.  Today- (April 27)- the temperature is 51 degrees.  On April 25- we had 0.58 inches of rain: the only measureable rain of April.  The wind is variable and about 15 mph.  The pontoon swings around- making water sampling difficult (the temperature meter drop line has to be vertical to assure accurate depth)- and Secchi very difficult.  We would not have done the sampling- except we will be away for a while and wanted to hit the suggested 2-4 week after-ice-out window.

06/29/2009,May was the third driest in history.  We had 1-3/4? of rain on June 21 but are still about 6? above normal for the year.  May was cooler than normal- although we did have a 90 degree day near the middle of May.  The past week (June 22-28) has been very hot: daytime temps between 85 and 90 degrees.  Nonetheless- this June is the eight coolest on record.  Today (June 29) is partly cloudy and a beautiful- slightly breezy- 73 degrees .  When we took the Secchi reading on Cranberry- clouds and a slight ripple on the surface affected the Secchi reading somewhat: we recorded 8.5 .  On Minerva- the clouds opened and the ripple on the surface lessened.  We recorded a Secchi reading of 12.5 feet- which is the best I can recall ever recording.
07/03/2009,The previous week has been very cool (highs mostly in 60s and 70s).  June has been cooler and dryer than normal.  Today (July 3) is beautiful: 80 degrees with a northwest breeze.
07/18/2009,It is a cloudy day- with northwest wind about 10 mph.  Not a good day for a Secchi reading- but we did it for the Secchi  Dip In data.  the temperature is 65 degrees: overnight it was 54 degrees- the coldest for this date since 1962.  We had 1.3" of rain on July 15.  We are still about 7" below normal for the year.
08/02/2009,This has been the coldest start for July (through July 15 2009) since 1972.  Twelve of the first 15 days are below average.  July 17th high (59 in cities- 53 in Rice Lake)- is the lowest high since 1939.  The expected low (50 in Minneapolis)- is the lowest low since 1962.  Last year- which was not otherwise a hot summer- we had six days of 90 and above in July.  This year we have had zero.  Our only 90 or above day this year came in May.  We got 1 ? 1-1/2? of rain in Danbury on July 15.  We are still about 7? below normal for the year- and 15? below normal- including last year.  Many trees are suffering this year.  This is largely because we had late winter rains and freezing.  With the ground still frozen- and a very warm early spring- the trees sought nourishment from the ground- but could not get it from the frozen mass.  We are late with the July sampling.  Our pontoon outboard ceased ?peeing?.  We removed the lower unit and replaced the water pump impeller: no change.  We removed the lower unit again and replaced an upper ?O? ring in the water pump: no change.  Finally- suspecting a plugged water tube- or indicator circuit- we removed the indicator hose and blew back through the indicator nipple into the water tube.  A fragment of a rubber paddle from the original impeller spit out.  Finally- our problem is solved- but July is over.  It is 66 degrees  at 10:30.  It is expected to reach 80 degrees .  The sky is a bright overcast- and the wind is west about 10MPH: not a perfect day for Secchi readings.
08/23/2009,August 13-15 were very hot (90 degrees on august 13).  Since- it has been more seasonal (Highs of 70-80).  We had 3.7? of rain on August 20.  Temperature at sampling time is 69 degrees.  There is some chop.
05/16/2010,Sunny- 72 degrees- choppy- some clouds.  Had 2-1/2" of rain on May 13/14.

The weather since the last sampling of 2009 needs mention.  The weather alternated monthly.  We set many records.  September was the fourth hottest on record- and dry.  We had 5? of rain from October 1-8.  There were snowfalls of about two inches on both October 9 and 11: this was only the third time in 40 years that two measureable snowfalls occurred this early in October.  Overall- October was the second wettest an fourth coldest in history.  November was the second warmest in history.  Only one day was at or below the normal daytime/nighttime temperature.  It was also extremely dry.  Only about 0.5 inches of snow- on the last day of deer hunting: November 29.  The average snowfall in November is about 5?.  December 1-3 temperatures were above the normal daytime/nighttime high/low.  Beginning with December 4- we were below normal.  Some of the November 29 snow is still visible.  Just before Christmas we had about 12 inches of snow.  Unfortunately- it was intermingled with rain and freezing rain.  As a result- there is water on the ice under the snow- making it impossible to navigate- either on foot or by motorized vehicle.  January 1 through January 10- 2010- we had only had one day that was ?normal?.  Otherwise- we had an extended cold snap (well below zero most nights- with single digit highs).  As a result- our lakes were now navigable: the water previously covering the ice apparently absorbed the snow before freezing up.  There was now about 2? of snow on top of good ice.  February was colder than normal- and dry.  March was very warm.  April was the warmest on record.  The ?meteorological spring?- (March and April) was the warmest on record.  March had zero measurable snowfall: a first since records were kept in 1884.  Unofficial Reports from the 1860s (probably from army forts) report one such year that matched this event.  On May 7- we had measurable snow.  On May 20- we had 95 degrees- which eclipsed the previous high for that date by 8 degrees.


06/06/2010,Cloudy- but brighrt: 64 degrees.  Some chop.   We had 1-3/4 inches of rain since June 1.  This data also for Path 26 Satellite use.
06/20/2010,Partly cloudy- 70 degrees: northwest breeze 5 10 mph..  We have had 1-3/4 inches of rain since June 14.  The water level is now normal.  
06/28/2010,Partly cloudy- 72 degrees- NE wind about 10 mph.  We have had approximately 8" of rain since out last sampling on May 6.
08/08/2010,It is partly cloudy and 82 degrees - with a slight northerly breeze.  We had thunderstorms and 0.8? of rain overnight.  A string of days in the upper 80s and lower 90s- with dew points in the upper 60s and low 70s began on August 6.  There are mossy algae ?blobs? in the secluded bays.  Coontail is very abundant- and is floating on the surface along many shorelines.


08/09/2010,This is a satellite flyover day.  It is 85 degrees- on the way to 90 degrees - with a dew point of 71 degrees .  A string of days in the upper 80s and lower 90s- with dew points in the upper 60s and low 70s began on August 6.  The sky is cloudless- with a breeze from the west.  There are mossy algae ?blobs? in the secluded bays.  Coontail is very abundant- and is floating on the surface along many shorelines.  Being Sunday- there is quite a bit of boat traffic.
08/29/2010,It is partly cloudy and 82 degrees .  The wind is SSE at 15-20 and gusty. We had 3.5? of rain on August 12 and 1.25? on August 13.  We added 0.2? on August 24.  So far this summer we have had 17 days of 90 degrees  or near 90 degrees  and dew points in the upper 60s or low 70s.  The average for the entire summer is 13.  Secchi readings and the temperature profile are difficult because the gusty winds make the pontoon swing.
09/26/2010,This is a flyover day for path 25.  It is clear and 57- with southwest wind of about 10 MPH.  We had 4? of rain on 23 September. August was the third warmest in history.  September has been cooler than normal.  The emergent weeds (e.g. Pickerel Weed) are dying.  We had frost  overnight on September 26/27.
05/10/2011,Ice out was 15 April- 7- 10 days later than normal.  There were approximately 85? of snow this winter.  It has been an unusually cool- cloudy- rainy- and windy spring.  Oak and maple trees are barely budding- and birches are still further behind. Goslings hatched about May 1.  The temp when beginning sampling is 75 degrees .  There is a bright haze and about a 10 MPH wind from the east.  There is some chop: Secchi reading is difficult.
06/12/2011,The temperature reached 100 degrees  on Tuesday- June 7.  It was 46 degrees  overnight on June 11.  There has been very little rain since June 1.  It is 70 degrees  with a slight Southeast breeze.
06/26/2011,June has been an unusually cloudy- windy month- with 4 or 5? of rain. We reached a record high of 100 degrees  on June 7.  Today s high is expected to be 78 degrees : current tempi is 70 degrees .  Cloudy and choppy: Secchi reading is difficult.
07/02/2011,July 2- 2011  Secchi Only
The temperature reached 97 degrees  on July 1.  The predicted storms hit as a cold front moved in.  At 8 PM a cold front moved in and a severe thunderstorm hit- with winds of 100 MPH and higher.  There were ?fingers/downdrafts/microbursts? (pick your noun)- that caused the damage to be more severe in scattered pockets.  The storm itself moved at 65 MPH- so there was little advanced warning.  .  The lake looked almost like the biblical ?parting of the sea?.  Two more storms came through between then and 9:30- but none were severe.  The damage around the lake- including snapped power lines and blocked roads- is severe.  Many large trees are down: both snapped off and uprooted.  Some damage to vehicles and campers in for the 4th of July weekend.  Traffic coming in for the weekend was backed up a long distance between Hayden Lake Road and Highway 35.  Headlights illuminated the night as locals and others with chain saws cleared the road just north of the bridge to Falk Lake.

Today it is clear- 80 degrees - with west wind of 15 MPH.  Chop makes Secchi reading difficult.


07/18/2011,July 18- 2011  Secchi only

This is a Satellite Sensing day.  It is 91 degrees  at sampling time (noon).  It has been over 90 degrees  the last three days.  There is some chop.


07/31/2011,July 31- 2011 Secchi + chemical sampling

On July 1- we had a terrific thunderstorm.  One hundred plus MPH winds with downdrafts- causing pockets of extreme damage.  Overall- the storm leveled 20-000 acres of timber in Burnett County.  It affected an area about 50 miles to south x 75 miles- east to west- including other counties- and some in Minnesota (e.g. St. Croix State Park was severely damaged).  This does not include the hundred of individual property owners that encountered severe damage to trees- buildings- vehicles- campers- etc.  

It was Friday- the beginning of the 4th of July holiday- so many visitors were in the area.  Many of their vehicles/campers were damaged- or destroyed.

It was also the weekend of festivities commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Siren tornado.

That Friday the daytime temperature reached 97 degrees : then a cold front approached.  NOAA radio warned of the storm- indicating the storm itself was travelling west to east at 65 MPH.  Damaging wind and the possibility of hail were included: those in the path and listeners were told to seek cover immediately.

At 8 PM a cold front moved in and a severe thunderstorm hit- with winds of 100 MPH and higher.  There were ?fingers/downdrafts/micro bursts? (pick your noun)- that caused the damage to be more severe in scattered pockets.  The storm itself moved at 65 MPH- so there was little advanced warning.  .  The lake looked almost like the biblical ?parting of the sea?.  Two more storms came through between then and 9:30- but none were severe.  The damage around the lake- including snapped power lines and blocked roads- is severe.  Many large trees are down: both snapped off and uprooted.  Some damage to vehicles and campers in for the 4th of July weekend.  Traffic coming in for the weekend was backed up a long distance between Hayden Lake Road and Highway 35.  Headlights illuminated the night as locals and travelers with chain saws cleared the road just north of the bridge to Falk Lake.

Stories spread quickly as people came to the roads serving the cabins.  On our Minerva Circle- two visitors- one an 89 year old man were in tent campers that had trees fall on them: both narrowly escaped.  One had the tree between him and the door- and could not get out for quite some time.

Local gas stations brought in the huge rented generators within a day- so pumps were functional.  However- it was cash only- with no change available once the first customers emptied the tills.  And the banks were not open to withdraw funds.  The local grocer was not open- but had semis come in with truckloads of ice

Most residents were without power for a week- and several for over two weeks.  Power companies from adjacent counties- including some in MN- and even a city in southern WI came forward to assist.  The main reason for the extreme time to restore power- besides the huge task of tree removal- was that countess power poles were snapped off- which led to the logistical problem of locating replacement poles- and then clearing areas to gain access and replace them.

The loss of power- plus theurn of extreme heat- caused  many visitors to return home- and made the tedious job of clean up even more exhausting.

This July is the fourth hottest in history.  We have had twelve days of 90 degrees  and above- and several more above 85 degrees .  There was an historical high dew point of 82 degrees .  Several days had heat indices over 100 degrees . 


08/29/2011,It is Cloudless and 75 degrees - with WNW wind of 15 MPH.  Have had about 2" of rain in August.  It has been in the low to mid 50s the past three nights.  Blue/green algae were discovered in the main channel of Minerva (livid- like Packer Green) "Paint Spots" on August 14: it was not evident in Cranberry.  They congregated some because of flow when the pontoon was anchored.  Happy 5th birthday to our black lab "Moxie".
09/12/2011,This is a Remote Sensing Day.  It is clear- with temperature of 82 degrees : expected to reach 90 degrees .  The wind is southwest 10-15 mph: heavy chop.  The wind is southwest 10-15 mph: heavy chop.  We have only had about 1/2" of rain in the last few weeks- and the temperatures have been above normal.  The last few nights the temps were in the low to mid fifties.
04/23/2012,The day is sunny- with variable breeze at about 5 mph.  The temperature is 55 degrees.  The loons are active.  They arrived shortly after the middle of March.

Much background is needed to set a baseline for this lake sampling season.

March blew away the temperature record from 1910.  The Average high was 15 degrees above normal.  From March 10 to the 21st- 10 of the 12 days set new records.  Typical highs during this time are in the 40s: all the highs were about 30 degrees  above normal.  That not only blew away the previous March record- it set a record as the greatest number of degrees above normal for any month in recorded history. 

Understandably- the ice on our lakes went out very early: Cranberry on March 22 and Minerva on March 23.  A typical ice out date is April 6.  Last year- with the snowy- cold winter- ice out was April 20.  Since the beginning of our "meteorological spring" (March- April- and May) was preceded by a winter quarter (summarized below) of very warm readings- the early ice out is expected.

The "Meteorological Winter"- from December 2011 through February 2012 continued as an unusual weather year.  The average snowfall for this period is 28": we have had about 14" (last year during this period we had over 40").  The average number of below zero readings in this period is about 20: we have had 3.  This is the second fewest on record: the record is 2 (I believe set in 2002).  As of 2/9/2012 our average temperature was 26.7 degrees  for this winter period.  This is the fourth warmest in history: the previous record temperature to this date- 1877-1878 was 29 degrees .  Interestingly- 1930-31 is in second place and 2001-2002 in third

Ice over occurred on December 2- 2011- on both Minerva and Cranberry lakes.  This compares to November 25 of last year- which is more typical date.  Ice fishing on foot was possible by mid December.  It was not until after January 1- 2012- that ATV traffic was safe.  Larger vehicle traffic was not safe until mid-late January. Thus- with the early March warm up- we effectively had about a five week ice fishing season.  And to top it off- the fishing was terrible.  The unusual weather meant many barometer swings- which the fish- being pressure sensitive- do not like: they have constant tummy aches.

Also- with the extreme lack of snow- snowmobile trails were not opened until mid February: basically wiping out the season. 

Both of the above led to extreme hardship of many retailers depending on winter sports to carry them through the year.

On a related note- maple syrup producers were hardly able to collect enough sap- at 40:1 per gallon of syrup- to even begin the boiling.   February began warm- with some below freezing nights- so the sap began to flow.  Then as February turned to march- there were no more nights below freezing.  The taps need some continuity to continue to produce- so they dried up.  The normal number of productive days for the producers is thirty: this season there were six. 

April has been a month of below normal temperatures.  We had measureable snow on April 15.  This is a godsend in some respects.  Since fish spawn at certain temperatures- the early spawners (e.g. Crappie) were nearly ready to spawn at the end of March.  If April had continued warm- the females would have deposited their eggs- probably before the eggs were mature- and we may have lost an entire year class of fish.  It also would have affected Perch and Walleye.


05/14/2012,The temperature in the shade on shore (from the same digital thermometer we use for lake temperature profile) is 80 degrees .  The ambient on the pontoon (no shade on the lake!) is 90 degrees .  It is sunny- with southwest wind about 10 MPH.  We had 3.5" of rain May 6th- and a total of 4.5" from May 1-6.  It has been dry since.  Due to the amount of tinder remaining from the July 1- 2011 storm- there is a burning ban that will probably last through the year until measurable snow is present.  This means no burning permits will be issued.  The ban includes campfires- fireworks- and even smoking (the latter is included in the recording received when calling in for burning information).

This spring sample is intended to be taken within two weeks after ice out.  The ice went out March 23.  However- we did not receive our materials until May 3.
   

06/03/2012,The ambient on the pontoon (no shade on the lake!) is 82 degrees .  It is sunny- with northwest wind about 5MPH.  We had 3.5" of rain May 6th- and a total of 4.5" from May 1-6.  Then- between May 17th and 31st we had a rainfalls of 4" and 2".   Therefore- in May we had a total of 10.5" of rain.  In the twin cities- the record for May was 10"- set in 1906.  The Twin Cities received 9.5" of rain- so did not break the 1906 record.  It is fairly safe to say that we broke the previous record in the Danbury area- so are making the claim that we have a new all time record.

Incidentally- the average rainfall for May is about 2".   Since May is the first month of "Meteorological" summer- there is a good chance we will set the record for summer also.

The Yellow and St. Croix rivers are over their banks in places.  The levels on Minerva and Cranberry Lakes are only slightly above normal- indicating the water table must have needed replenishing.

06/18/2012,It is partly sunny- the air temp is 86 degrees on the lake at noon- and the wind is west at about 10 MPH.  The rainfall to date in June is:  2" June 14- 0.5" June 16- and 0.3" overnight during storms on June 17/18.  Then- following this sampling- we had 1.75" of rain during an overnight storm on June 19/20.  

In addition to the previously reported 10.5 inches of rain for May- a record we can claim for the Danbury area- we have had a total of 4.55" for the period of June through June 20. 
Thus- for the "meteorological summer" of May- June- and July- we may be on pace to break the all time summer rainfall total.

07/04/2012,
This is a satellite flyover day.  There is a bright overcast.   Wind is between 5-10 mph:  a strong ripple.  We are in the ninth consecutive day of 90+ temps- with only 0.6" of rain in that interval.  The air temperature on the lake is 93 degrees . The surface temperature of the water is 84.7 degrees .

08/18/2012,This was a  Secchi-only day.  It was a difficult Secchi day.  The breeze was northeast at about 10 MPH.  The water in both Minerva and Cranberry seemed more cloudy than normal.  Perhaps some of the cause is that the Secchi was done around the 4 PM hour.  At that lower sun angle a Secchi reading- which must be done on the shady side of the pontoon- coupled with the wind direction created a situation where there was not much solar illumination in the area of the disk.   We will see what subsequent readings reveal.

This has been a very historic period.  July was reported as the hottest on record "for the lower 48 states".  Minnesota's records show it is still the second hottest (1936 remains the hottest).  So- our area experienced either the first or second hottest July on record.

For the 45 day period beginning June 25- the daily high temperature exceeded 80 degrees  (that means through August 9).  At least ten of those daytime highs exceeded 90 degrees .  The nighttime lows were typically above 65 degrees 

Surface air temperature in both lakes was about 75 degrees at sampling time.  Surface water about 73 degrees .  

09/01/2012,This is Labor Day weekend.  The lake is very busy.  The sky is bright- with a slight haze.  The wind is variable between NW and SW at about 15 MPH.  With the chop and boat wakes it is difficult to hold anchor.  The temperature on land is 80 degrees .  The Air temperature on the lake is 83 degrees .  August 28-31 were 90 degrees  or above.  Minnesota TV reports there have been 30 days of 90 or above this summer to date.  It is safe to say we have had at least 15. The surface water is 74.3 degrees  on Cranberry: 75.2 degrees  on Minerva.
09/30/2012,This is a satellite flyover day.
The air temperature on shore is 64 degrees .  Surface air on the water is 74.3 degrees .   Surface water temperature is 61.1 degrees .  
The water level is still low.  However- it has come up- since there was a 6" timber added to the dam in August.  This September is the third driest on record.  The driest was in 1882.  Ironically- the second driest was last year: 2011.
We have not had frost as yet.


05/26/2013,Ice out was May 9.  Normal ice out is during the first two weeks of April. 

Cranberry s 2012 ice over occurred on December 5: Minerva s December 10.  Beginning with these December dates- the temperatures were quite cold- so ice formed quickly before snow cover was a factor.  As winter progressed- the ice formed clear and hard.  When snows arrived- and began to pile up- the ice was firm- and relatively thick.  In late February- we received some rain- followed by very cold temperatures.  This dissolved some of the snow and formed a secondary ice cover above the base. Travel with an ATV was no longer an option: the tires would break through the secondary layer and have no traction on the ice below.  Walking was also difficult.  Even during this stage the solid ice was about 30  thick.  Then- March and April snows came- re-insulating the ice.  It became obvious ice out would be very late- unless rains or abnormally warm temperatures occurred: they did not.  In 2012- there were 90 degree temperatures in March and April!  This April- we probably set an all time record for April snow depth:  We had more than 30 .  Wisconsin s fishing opener was May 5.   Cranberry was ice-free- but there was no way to reach it from the Falk landing: Minerva still had solid ice. 

We have had two inches of rain since ice out- and temps have been below normal.  At this sampling date- there is bright overcast- with winds at about 20 mph- variable from east to southwest.   The temperature on shore is 70 .  The air temperature on the lake is 64 .   It is difficult to hold anchor.

06/30/2013,We had 3.5 inches of rain thus past week.  This is a very unusual early summer: rain every week.  We probably have had 10 inches of rain in May and June.  There is a bright hazy sky.  The haze is said to b from wild fires in Ontario.  The temperature on shore is 69 degrees.  The surface air at the sampling site is 75.5 degrees.  The wind is northeast 5-10 MPH.

07/29/2013,Up until the middle of July- this has been a summer of cooler than normal temperatures and above normal rainfall.  I saw a comparison with 2012 about a week ago.  In 2012- we had a summer of 31 days above 85 degrees.  In 2013 we have had less than ten.  However- since June 30- we have had a total of about 0.5  of rain.  July 14-20 were very hot- humid- and windy (85-90 each day and 70 or above overnight.  Since July 22 it has been very nice: 65-72 during the day and 48-55 at night.  We had 0.2  of rain overnight on July 25. Today is partly sunny with a SW wind 10-15 MPH.  The temperature on shore is 75 degrees.  The air temperature on the lake at sampling time is 82 degrees.

 
08/31/2013,August has been one of the hottest and driest on record.  We have had less than ? inch of rain.   The last 6 days have been 90 degrees or more. One report said it is the worst since 1948.  It has also been extremely windy. We only took one Secchi reading this month: the wind and sun angle- coupled with the fact than the anchor would not hold the pontoon- never cooperated.  The shore temp is 75 degrees: the air temp at the sampling site at 11:15 AM is 80 degrees.  It is mostly sunny- with a south wind of about 10 MPH.


06/01/2014,Air temp is 78 degrees.  Wind  is SW 10 MPH.  We learned this week that the official snowfall depth for Danbury the past winter season was 155 inches!  Ice out occurred on 6 May 14: since then- we have had about 9 inches of rain- 4 inches of which were in the past week.  The lake is bout 6 inches above any recent high water mark.  Air temp onshore at sampling time is 78 degrees.   

06/01/2014,We learned this week that the official snowfall depth for Danbury the past winter season was 128 inches!  And- coupled with a ?Polar Vortex? (a pocket of very cold air that sits over the polar region for a prolonged period of time)- the ice still reached a thickness that delayed ice out.   Ice out occurred on 6 May 14: normally- the ice is out by 15 April.  Since ice out- we have had about 9 inches of rain- including 1.5 inches overnight and 2.5 inches earlier this week.  The lake is about 6 inches above any recent high water mark.

Air temp onshore at sampling time is 78 degrees:  air temp on the lake is 81 degrees.  The wind is SW at about 10 mph. The sky is a bright overcast- but the overall conditions make Secchi reading difficult. 

06/08/2014,This is for satellite fly over.  Wind N.E. about 10 MPH.  Bright haze.  1.2 " rain on 6 June.    
06/10/2014,Bright haze.  Air temp 74 degrees. Wind west bout 10 mPH.  We have had 3" of rain since 3 June.
06/22/2014,Bright haze.  Air temp 72 degrees wind SW 5-10 MPH.  Had 1.5" of rain on 18 June.
06/30/2014,Late evening sky.  Air temp 73 degrees.
07/10/2014,Partly cloudy.  Shore temp 82 degrees.  Wind SW abosut 10 MPH.  0.3" rain since 1 July.  Secchi difficult because only shade is in rear of pontoon.
07/27/2014,air temp 72 degrees.  Wind NW about 10  Partly cloudy to cloudy.

This was a very nice July.  We only had 2 days with temps above 90 degrees- compared to last year?s 19!  And- there was sufficient rain until mid July.  Since then- the rain has been sparse: less than 1 inch.  Nationally and world-wide- this summer has been very hot.  The only cool pocket is in the Midwest.  One thing that is ever present is the wind: there are very few calm days.  Secchi readings are difficult under windy conditions.  And- on many days we could not do sampling or Secchi because the anchor could not hold the pontoon.  Until mid July- the lake was high: since- it has been normal- or low.  Perhaps they took a timber out of the dam.

It has been an unusual summer for bugs.  Because of the wet spring- the mosquitoes have been more numerous- especially during the bright hours of the day- when they are usually not active.  When out of the wind- they are around. 

On the other hand- the deer flies- which usually come in the first two weeks of June and last through July- did not arrive until early July: we suppose that means they will last through August.  Likewise- there are fewer gnats than in the past.  Both may be because in mid-December of 2013 we had an 18 inch snowfall at around 32 degrees.  Then- the temperatures dropped to below zero- resulting in a thick coating of ice on the snow.  And- the snow continued to be frequent.  Officially- we had 155 inches of snow!  Smaller Evergreen trees (12 feet and under) were OK under the snow line- but above the snow line there was much browning: hopefully they will overcome it before the next winter season.  

 



09/02/2014,Had 3-1/2inches of rain on 8/29 and 1 inch on 8/30.  Cloudless sky.  Shore air temp 69 degrees.Wind about 15 mph: choppy.  Lake air temp at sampling: 80 degrees
10/11/2014,Shore tmperature 53 degrees- wind SW 10 mph: choppy.  Lake air temp at sampling: 61 degrees.

The September sampling had to be postponed until 11 October.  The days we were at the lake in September (approximately 28 days) were extremely windy: we could not hold anchor on the pontoon- which is required for both Secchi reading and temperature profile. 

Worldwide September temperatures set an all time record high since records have been kept (135 years).  The temperatures in WI- and much of the Midwest- were about normal.

Footnote: Our ice over date was 14 November 2014: about two weeks ahead of normal.

05/01/2015,6+ inches of rain in April.  Accumulating snow on April 21. Shore temp 62 degrees.  Air temp on lake 64 degrees.
06/29/2015,Hazy.  Shore temp 80 degrees.  Distant thunder.  NW breeze.
07/13/2015,We had 2.5." of rain on 7/5 and 1.5" on 7/12.  temps in the 80s for the last three days.  Bright haze- slight variable breeze- some chop.
08/16/2015,Temp at 12:45 was 79 degrees.  the previous two days were in the upper 80s and humid.  SW wind about 10 MPH: some chop.
09/01/2015,Air Temp 78 degrees.  We are into the 3rd day of a heat wave (85/70-day/night temps typical).  We had approximately 8 inches of rain in August.    Bright Haze and SW wind about 10 mph: some chop.
05/08/2016,March waswarmer than average less than  April cooler than average.  Ice out occurred on 23 March.  We had 3 inches of rain on the weekend of 15 April- and have had ni rain since.  The temp on Friday- 6 May was 90 degrees- breaking the previous record for that date- set in 1934 (the Dust Bowl years).  Wind at sampling time is variable at about 10 mph. 

This year we have had an unusually high incidence of a small (3/16?)- thin black fly- with translucent wings.  they do not arrive in swarms- they rise individually- from the ground in large numbers.  They don?t usually bite- but land on you under glasses- etc.  They are ever-present- so when you go inside- they are with you under your clothing.  They amass on the inside of the windows- and are dead by morning.  They have tapered off since about 10 May- probably because it became cooler than normal.  We suppose it will be them again- and maybe gnats also- when the weather warms- as expected the weekend of 21 May.

07/04/2016,The June 2016 sample- preferably in the last two weeks of the month- was 
performed on July 4- 2016.  The min reasons the sampling delayed into July was the June 25th 6:30 PM windstorm that caused significant tree loss in the immediate vicinity of our residence (29667 Minerva Circle) and the properties north and south of us (on the west leg of Minerva Circle) We lost 15 trees- six of which were on the ?finished? portion of our lot.: the balance were in the wooded area between us an the neighbor to the south- and across Minerva circle from our lake site.  We and other neighbors cleared two trees that blocked the west leg.  Included in our loss were about 30 feet of the tops of 3 of the 75 foot Norway pines planted by the CCCs in the mid 1930s.

We believe the damage was as localized as it was because of a ?Microburst? occurring along with an approximate 60 MPH straight line wind- with gusts to 70 MPH.  A microburst is a downdraft that- when it hits the ground results in an ?explosion? of wind radiating in all directions.  The pines and an oak were felled by wind from the west (the main direction of the wind).  However- ten trees in the ?rough between us and the neighbor to the south fell to wind from the north- even though shielded by our high Gambrel-roofed garage. 

This storm was 6 days shy of five years from the July 1st 2011 storm that flattened 110-000 acres of timber in MN and WI.  That one had 100 MPH winds from a wall cloud.  Everyone around the area was without power for at least a week- and some for as long as three weeks.  And the temps were in the high 80s most of that time.  Power companies from neighboring states and beyond were summoned to help restore power.  Power generators sold out in the twin ports and win cities immediately after the roads were cleared and folks could get out.

One that was behind us- we waited until July 4th to sample and do the lab work.  Otherwise- the shipment would sit is post offices until after the 4th anyway- and the iced samples would be suspect.

The shore temperature at the approximate 3 PM sampling time was 79 degrees- the wind west at about 10 MPH. We had 2 inches of rain during the June 25th storm- and ? inch since.  The chop made the secchi reading difficult on Cranberry Lake- but secchi on Minerva was not impaired.

As an aside- since this data is being entered on July 19th we had at least 10-1/2 inches of rain on Sunday night/Monday morning July 10/11.  This amount was reported by Steve and Peg Johnson on the south side of Minerva Lake.  They emptied their rain gauge before bedtime with 4 inches of accumulation.  Monday morning- the 6 inch capacity rain gauge had overflowed.  All local rivers overflowed their banks.  Our lakes rose about a foot immediately following the storm.   

07/31/2016,Shore temp 78 degrees. Party cloudy.  Wind WSW approx 10 mph. Had 2" of rain during a severe windstorm on 25 June: about 1/2"since.   
08/30/2016,Temperature 78 degrees.  Wind Northwest approx 10 mph.  We had two inches of rain  the past two weeks- which brings us over 40 inches for the season- likely an all time record.  I has also bee the hottest on record to date.  Secchi difficult: probably due to recent rainfall. Temperature 78 degrees.  Wind Northwest approx 10 mph.  We had two inches of rain  the past two weeks- which brings us over 40 inches for the season- likely an all time record.  I has also bee the hottest on record to date.
05/08/2017,Air temp on lake 76 degrees.  Wind SE (variable).  Had about 3" rain since ice out.
06/12/2017,76 degrees on lake. Wind SW 5 mph.  2-1/2 " rain on 6/10: 6" since May sampling.  Was 90mdegrees on 6/9- 6/10- 6/11.
