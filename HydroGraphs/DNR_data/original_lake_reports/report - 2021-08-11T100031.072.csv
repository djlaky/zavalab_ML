Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
06/27/1996,Public perception is somewhere between 3-4- but plants are the problem (weeds) not algae.    
07/21/1996,Many weeds.    
09/02/1996,Not much algae- but many many weeds!    
05/17/1997,Dead plants still standing tall.    
06/22/1997,Recent rains.    
07/31/1997,Many weeds. not as many as last year.    
08/31/1997,More rain- lake level is still down more than last month- lots of weeds (is a problem).    
10/02/1997,Weeds are dying.

07/29/1998,LAKE SAMPLE    
08/26/1998,LAKE SAMPLE    
01/02/2001,Aeration running 9pm to 8am- snow cover of 6"    
10/20/2002,Overcast conditions- W wind 5-10 mph- Heavy aquatic vegetation still present.  Water levels beginning to increase from previous lows.  Lake level still 2 1/2 feet low from normal.    
05/31/2003,Aquatic plants are growing and emerged.  Floating
algae blooms are more abundant this spring than in previous years.
Aquatic plants cover 70% of lake surface.    
06/15/2003,Lake water level is low.
Chemical treatment of water shield and white and yellow water lilies
treatment area 2.4 acres on June 7th- 2003 Chemical use "Navigate" 2- 4-D
Filamentous algae present lake wide June 15th    
07/07/2003,Chemical treatment of lillies is visible however the
plants are slow to die off.  Almost all algae that was present in June is
now gone.    
07/25/2003,Sunny- light breeze from south west. Aquatic plants
flurishing.  Chemical treatment areas showing some aquatic plant distress.    
10/11/2003,Lake water level continues its decline.  Water level
is down 10" for this year.  This would be about 4 feet down over the last
4 years.  Aquatic plant treatment areas show high amount of success with
very little plant matter in those areas. Some algae is present on the lake
bottom in shallow areas- non appeared floating.  Fish presence also noted
in shallows.
    
06/09/2004,Overcast conditions- air temperature 60 degrees- wind 12 mph from the NNE- lake surface waves.  Plant vegetation located in 2003 treatment areas is showing residual effects of chemical treatment.  Floating plants are almost non-existant in the treated areas- which shows great success.  Fish are visable in these open areas.  No algae visable so far this year.    
06/18/2004,Overcast sky- air temperature 73 degrees- wind direction WNW 8-10MPH. Water level increasing due to recent heavy rain storms. Lake water level has increased over 1-foot since fall 2003.  Possible summer stratification occuring causing low DO levels on lake bottom.    
07/06/2004,Overcast sky- Wind NNW 8-12MPH- Light Drizzle.  Lake water level continues to rise.  Heavy rain July 3rd (1"+)
Zooplankton visable in water samples.    
08/22/2004,Sunny- wind WNW 5-10 MPH pleasant breeze.  Lake level remained stationary from July to August.  Level is up over last several years.  Water is Rusty Brown in color with decaying plant fragments floating.  No algae present.  Bladderwort is present in treatment areas.    
08/27/2004,Clear-wind W 10-15 MPH.  Water remains stained rusty-brown with decaying plant matter floating.    
10/17/2004,Strong wind (20mph+)from the WNW- overcast sky- air temperature 47 degrees.  Aquatic plants are dying back for the season.  Water color remains dark and stained.    
06/29/2005,Partly sunny- air temperature 74 degrees- wind ENE light and variable.    
08/07/2005,Light SW wind- sunny- air temp 88'.  Very abundant plant growth in lake- water level down approximately 8 inches since spring 2005.  Water is dark but clear- with no alge in lake    
10/11/2005,Lake water level is down 12 inches since spring of 2005.  Aquatic plants are dying off. Waterfowl present.  Overcast day with light drizzle and NE winds at 15mph    
09/24/2007,Lake conditions
12/05/2007,Winter conditions Ice over
09/28/2008,Lake water level is still quite low.  Approximate level 5' below normal.
06/15/2017,Lake water levels have been rising significantly over the last several years.  Lake plant vegetation is now appearing on the lake surface- but the amount of plants seem to be reduced from previous years due to current higher water levels.
06/01/2018,Lake water levels are higher over previous year
05/26/2019,Lake water level is at its highest since 1997 and close to historic high levels.  Water lily roots are now dying and floating to the surface in large amounts.  Cattail marsh in this west basin area are now losing root attachment and small bog like flotations are moving by wind around the lake.  Marsh like bogs are under 10' in length and several feet in width.  Over the past decade water levels on this seepage lake have gone from extremely low conditions with plant vegetation cover almost all of the lake surface area to a lake this year that is seeing very little plant vegetation and more people using the lake for recreation.  Weather conditions have been cool and wetter than normal.  Wood ducks are beginning to next and sandhill cranes are utilizing the lake.  One loon was spotted this spring.
07/04/2019,Lake is at near historic water levels with ephemeral areas now flooded.  Water plant vegetation is low compared to previous years of high plant concentrations around the lake.  Usage of the lake is higher with more boating activity and fishing activities.
10/02/2019,Past 24 hours received about 1" of rainfall.  Lake level had fallen about 3" over the last month- but now is recovering again to historic water levels.  Plant vegetation is limited on the surface as there has been a decrease of about 70% of vegetation hitting the surface this past summer.  Lake usage was up greatly this past summer as more individuals were canoeing or kayaking.  
02/23/2020,Lake is covered with approximately 12" of snow cover.  Aeration does not appear to be creating an open area in the deep hole in the west basin.  Water level is at highest levels.  Significant tree loss is occurring where the lake water level is encroaching upon the tree root system.  Loss of white pine- birch and aspen is occurring on the west shorelines.  

Winter weather conditions for late 2019 into 2020 were mild with low snowfall early in the winter season- but snowfall did catch up to normal depths by late February.  Mild weather was observed in late February with some snow cover melting.
04/01/2020,Ice is totally off the lake surface on this date.  Aeration system received maintenance-repairing drive belts that were worn.  Aeration ran successfully from early February to ice off.  No signs of any fish winter-kill.  Lake water levels remain at all time high level.
05/03/2020,Breezy weather with "Red Flag" warnings for Waupaca today.  Wind gusts at 25 mph during the secchi test.  Water appears with a tan-ish color on the white part of the secchi disc. Water depth continues to be at a very high level.  Aquatic plant life is void as of today.  The narrow area between both basins is showing last years aquatic plant which is decaying.  2 pontoon boats seen around the lake shore. 
11/08/2020,Last sechi measurement for 2020. Water levels are still very high but are now receding from historic high levels.  The 2020 late summer was drier than normal.  Water levels dropped approximately 8-10" due to the lack of precipitation.  Also in 2020 the lake plant vegetation declined to the point that boating activity returned.  A lot of kayakers from around the lake enjoyed a wonderful summer of clear open water.  

The lake has turned over (as of this report) and a brownish color was staining the water column.   No fishing reports were taken for 2020.  The WDNR fish biologist was contacted asking for a fish survey to be conducted in the future.  The WDNR advised it was uncertain if a survey would be conducted due to COVID-19 and lower staffing- but if time permited- a survey would be conducted.
