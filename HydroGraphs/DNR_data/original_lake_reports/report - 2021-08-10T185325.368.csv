We parked on Rice Lake Road and launched the canoe into the channel that runs parallel to the road.  The channel was easily navigable- but we did have pull the canoe over two active beaver dams. As we arrived to the lake- the wind picked up and dark clouds were heading our way. Because of this- we were not able to paddle the entire shoreline of the lake. ?
