09/19/2018,This is a first reading taken by me. I was surprised at the 7' depth but after talking with Kris Larson- I'm writing it off as lake runoff/turn over.
09/05/2020,Perfect morning- very still. Lake water appears green with suspended particles. Decreased visibility may be due to abnormally high water levels triggering higher than normal phosphorus loads. Increased dust levels due to higher than normal trail traffic may also contribute throughout the season. Traffic on the lake has been a little higher this year than in past years. It's a perfect Labor day weekend. Beautiful weather. Still. Water level is very high. Lake is green in color with suspended particles. decreased clarity may be due to high water and increased way activity washing the shore. Perfect day to be on the lake.
