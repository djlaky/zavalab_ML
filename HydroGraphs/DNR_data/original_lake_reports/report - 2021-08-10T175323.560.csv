05/26/1999,Water level is 2" above the old high water mark + at least 12" higher than last August (1998).    
06/14/1999,Two loons swam within 25' of my pontoon boat.  Very content.  Two ospreys are on the nest with their young.    
07/17/1999,Two ospreys sitting on their nest feeding their young.  Lots of chirpin' + squeakin'.    
04/22/2000,2 loons were 40' from my pontoon boat and fishing- unconcerned with me- no ospreys on their nest yet.    
06/19/2000,Ospreys are on their nest-lots of chirpin and squeakin going on-sounds like young ones-also saw a mallard with young ones.    
06/30/2000,Ospry was feeding 2 young ones high on the nest-mouth to mouth fish- lots of pondweed blooming.    
08/11/2000,Pondweed is most abudant- chick osprey reported dead under a neighbors pier-given to DNR for a study.    
06/16/2001,2 loons and 2 ospreys were observed fishing.    
09/20/2001,Ospreys and loons went South for the winter.    
07/10/2002,Pondweed is growing in epic proportions- very abundant.    
08/11/2002,Large pondweed is horrible and covers more than half the lake! DNR will check it out 8-20-02.    
09/09/2002,70% of large pondweed was removed last week by mechanical harvesting. Loons and ospreys are still here.    
10/01/2002,The clearest the lake has ever been.
