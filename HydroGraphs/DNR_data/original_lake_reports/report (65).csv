6/17/2018 Father's Day Storm dumped 17+ inches of rain on area.
Lake rose 4.5 vertical feet in next 2 days. Pigeon Lake is the low spot of the watershed for 1 square mile- resulting in all the rain eventually flowing to- and staying in Pigeon Lake.
There is no inlet or outlet for the lake- so the water stays in the lake unless it evaporates or leaves via the aquifer
