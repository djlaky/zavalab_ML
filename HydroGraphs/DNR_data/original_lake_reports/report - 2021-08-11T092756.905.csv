07/12/2015,Water level seems to be dropping. Yes we need rain. Lake district trying to have Long Lake Dam closed to 1 inch. Loon hatch successful with 2 baby loons off the loon raft. Temps in mid 70's. Great day to be on water. Saw eagles perching in tall hemlocks. Slight greenish tint to water but very acceptable.
07/25/2015,Lake levels keep dropping. Cloudy earlier...but clear now. Just making excursion on lake for water chemistry. 
08/08/2015,Water levels are dropping drastically. One of the lowest levels EVER! Temps in mid 60's. Loons and loon chicks active searching for food. Fairly cloudy/overcast but still nice. (Rained yesterday 08/07/15)
08/30/2015,Somewhat windy. Temps in mid 70's. Loons active at both ends of lake. Lon chicks are growing fast...about 2/3 adult size. Water levels QUITE CONCERNING being so low. Lake district has contacted WVIC for support. Family of mergansers playing on log at shoreline.
09/12/2015,Overcast and cloudy. Temps low 60's. Eagle perched in pine tree by thoroughfare. EWM in treated areas (chemical + hand pulling) appear to be successful (reduction). The loons are very active and ALWAYS fun to watch.
NOTE: Pulling boats out September 19th due to low water levels...Disturbing! Earliest date EVER! (There's confirmation of a  beaver dam in thoroughfare between Big Sand Lake and Long Lake.)
05/07/2016,Windy + rainy last night. It's been windy past few days. Light waves due to a brisk breeze. Opening day of fishing. 16 boat trailers at landing. About 57 degrees...cooler on the water. Seems like water has been stirred up by the recent winds?
05/30/2016,Windy earlier- slight winds now- About 70 degrees. Saw loon on nest on Loon Raft. Not much activity on lake for Memorial Day. Water conditions are good. 
06/12/2016,Light winds in the mid 70's. Tree Pollen on the water....especially at the shoreline. Lots of rain and wind in the past couple of days. Loon still on nest (loon raft). 
06/17/2016,Clear + Hot (80 degrees). Water calm. Lots of pollen floating on water....bays and shoreline are worse with less current to move pollen. Rain and wind have stirred up lake. Loon on Nest and Eagles in nest near thoroughfare.
07/04/2016,Very HOT last few days. Temp in high 70's. Water clarity good but a little less than normal. Maybe all the Holiday Activity on the lake? Saw a pair of loons with baby (appears to be only one). Lots of activity on lake and at shoreline enjoying the lake/water. 
07/16/2016,Nice afternoon for a boat ride. Saw a total of 4 adult loons and 3 GROWING baby loons. Lake and water were GREAT! Water clarity getting better!!!
07/31/2016,Perfect day on the water for ALL activities. Decent activity on lake and at shoreline. Eagles in tree by the thoroughfare.
08/07/2016,Absolutely gorgeous! Water is practically flat...no ripples/waves. Very uncommon on Long Lake. Saw loon with babies. Oh how the babies are growing. Water clarity very good. Very clear at the shoreline.
08/14/2016,Temp in low 70's. Light ripple on water. Overall water looks good. Saw Eagle and 3 loons. Quite a nice afternoon. 
08/27/2016,Nice but somewhat cloudy skies. Mid 60's. Water level remains at normal. That's unusual for this time of year. Many years of recent history it would be classified as low in late August.
09/02/2016,Great Night. Saw loons at both ends of the lake. Water clarity Excellent. Very little suspended particles.
09/23/2016,Another nice night. Water levels holding at NORMAL. In years past- the boats were out by now due to low water levels. Only saw the 3 baby loons. Have the adults left??? Seems a little early.
05/13/2017,Water appears to have some tanins as it is brown. Lots of rain + run off in the past month. Most notable when looking at bottom in shallow areas. Launched loon raft. High's in mid 60's. Sunny light winds.
06/23/2017,Temp in high 50's. Excessive rain in last month. Lots of run off. Had to pull boat out as dock was underwater. Water still has brown tanin tint. No loons on nest. Babies? 
07/04/2017,Mid 70's- Light wind + chop on water. Lots of activity on lake with boating- skiing- fishing and shoreline activity. Great day to enjoy the lake. Saw loons- eagles and mergansers. 
07/09/2017,Out for a morning pontoon boat ride. Temp in the 60's- barely any wind- Saw loons with just one baby. Starting to see more growth of all weeds possibly due to the added nutrients brought in by excessive rain.
07/19/2017,Nice day- warm in the mid 70's- good activity on lake for mid-week. Ducks at shoreline- loons feeding in deeper waters. Could see more resurgence of weed growth especially at south end (dam) of lake.
07/29/2017,Temp in the 70's- slight wind- water still has a slight brownish tint but fading and becoming more clear. Loons are active with baby....only one seen. Decent activity on lake with all types of boaters.
08/12/2017,Mid 60's Several fishermen on lake- good activity of all boat types. Baby loon is getting big. Out with adult loons fishing.Still concerned about EWM regrowth in some areas. 
08/25/2017,Light winds- activity on lake has decreased over the past couple of weeks. Loons and baby are actively fishing. Water clarity seems to be getting better and brownish tint is dissipating. 
09/03/2017,Winds are light- nice day on lake. The holiday increases activity. The last BIG weekend. Fishermen are the most abundant today. 
05/19/2018,Put in Loon Raft today. Calm winds and quite sunny. Loons were on the raft minutes after in was secure. What an experience. Water quality was superior and very clear on the surface.
06/16/2018,Wind was light with some gusts. Slight drizzle at times. Temperature in Mid-60's. Loon on raft. Only fishermen out at this time. Weather could be nicer. 
06/24/2018,Slight brownish-green tint to water as plant growth is booming. big rains on 6/17. Water still looked OK. Eagle in big hemlock stalking prey. A few boats are out exploring the lake.
07/03/2018,Mid 80's. Slight chop on water. Fourth of July brings out great activity on lake from skiers to pontooning to kayaking and many people enjoying time at the shoreline. Nice to see landowners enjoying the lake. Great Day!
07/09/2018,Busy on lake. Good Activity. Light winds and high around 80 degrees. Again- all different types of water activities are present. Water in some of the bays seems a little stagnant and still but no issues. 
07/28/2018,Again- a little choppy on lake. Any wind out of the south west creates waves as it travels long distances on Long Lake. 2 Loon babies are out with adults. Water very clear especially at the shoreline. 
08/12/2018,Baby loons are growing and learning to dive. A few boats out fishing by thoroughfare. Eagle in tree near the boat landing. Water quality is still great.
08/25/2018,Overcast. Light drizzle when returning to dock. EWM very noticeable along with other aquatic plants. Good growth is evident but concerned on EWM issue. 
09/03/2018,Good Activity on lake all holiday weekend. Loons are active with babies. The young loons are venturing a little further away from the parents. Milfoil and Aquatic Plants are getting quite dense in some areas. 
05/20/2019,Ice out on May 3rd. Launched Loon Raft. No Loons in-sight. Temp in high 50's. Water level extremely high. A couple of inches of rain over the weekend. Great day to launch loon raft as only a slight wind. Water too high to put in some docks....ours for one.
06/16/2019,Heavy rain Saturday early morning. slight winds- light pollen in/on water (noticeable but not bad). Loons on the nest!
06/30/2019,Temp in 70's. Loons active near boat landing- Eurasian water milfoil is active and some areas of higher density- milfoil should not affect the casual boater but is most noticeable at the dam end of lake. Noice to see more activity on lake and at water's edge.
07/07/2019,Water level staying high (great news)- Lake is very active- nice evening for pontoon ride. 
07/21/2019,Loons out with babies- milfoil still active and matting in some areas- Eagles in nest at thoroughfare. 
07/28/2019,Water level is great staying high....usually it has dropped over a foot and goes from High to Normal heading to Low by this time of year. This is nice for docking boats. 
08/11/2019,Loon babies are growing. Water looks great but reads a lower clarity. Milfoil still is active and becoming more dense in areas. 
08/17/2019,Water levels still high. The rock we use to measure levels is still completely submersed. Nice afternoon to be on water. Activity on lake is good for late August.
09/01/2019,Water is near high water level at dam. Nice consistency of water level this summer. Good activity on lake for Labor Day weekend. Loons are active and saw some deer near the water.
09/16/2019,Very calm- some algae floating on top of water..making swirls. Looks a little disturbing but should rectify itself with a little breeze or boating activity. All loons are practically the same size. Actually- very enjoyable for a pontoon ride.
