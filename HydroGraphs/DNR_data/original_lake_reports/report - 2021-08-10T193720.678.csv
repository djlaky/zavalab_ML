08/09/2010,Lake up 8" due to storm on 8/7
08/10/2011,Peter Howe and Jim Gammon did the Temperature and D.O. (Pete's depth rope not quite long enough to reach bottom). Lake extremely high due to recent rains. Secchi 2 feet less than previous. Pete and Jim could see algae in the water column. Probably the worst mid-summer water clarity I've seen since I started monitoring. 
Note: D.O. data are suspect: Pete's device wasn't working properly. One week later there were fish on the bottom (34-37 ft) per Hummingbird locator. This shouldn't be possible if D.O. was zero.
07/09/2012,Small ( less than 1mm) microorganisms in water column- silver in color- look like little birds
