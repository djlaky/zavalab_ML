Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
10/30/2005,For all sample dates in 2005- disk is visible until it sinks into the muck which is very deep in places.  Loose material comes up with disk.  Water level is 2+ feet lower than normal.
04/25/2006,DEEP HOLE    
05/27/2006,Water is clear to muck were secchi sinks in.  Weeds are emerging with more than normal density.
07/07/2006,Weeds cover most of lake area except for a few deep and very mucky spots.
08/24/2006,DEEP HOLE    
09/03/2006,Water level is extremely low- probably 3 to 4 feet lower than normal.  Some piers are out of the water completely.
09/20/2006,DEEP HOLE    
07/05/2007,Water is very low
08/25/2007,Low water level  - down about 4 feet
09/03/2007,Lowest water level ever seen
05/10/2008,Water level is up 3.5 to 4 feet which is back to normal levels for spring.  
05/24/2009,Windy weather recently.  Large algae blooms apparent which are extremely rare for this lake
06/03/2009,Algae blooms continue.  Water clarity varies from area to area.  Where blooms are prominent- visibility is reduced to several feet.  Secchi ranged from 3 feet to 8 feet.

Windy
06/18/2009,Lake cleared up and is very clear once again.  Some areas had algae scum along shore or under boats that were in the water.  
09/06/2009,Lots of floating plants and scummy stuff in globs that break up if you try to scoop them up.  Appears to be an algae of sorts that clings to the floating plants.  Many people did not want to swim in it.  However- the water was clear.
09/24/2009,Lake has stayed very clear most of the summer.  Actually unusually clear.  Lots of minnows- pollywogs- blue gill and bass.  Significant drop in lake level in the last month.
05/31/2010,Lots of floating pine pollen and weeds but clarity is good
07/04/2010,Swimmers itch on several people this weekend
07/24/2010,Lots of floating weed masses and clumps of what appear to be filamentous algae.  Some reports of swimmers itch around July 4th.
08/01/2010,Lots of floating weeds and algae (filamentous )
08/11/2010,Getting slightly better but still yucky.  This has been the worst stretch of bad water observed on the lake since monitoring
05/27/2013,Weeds are low. No minnows or bluegill seen
07/20/2013,Hot weather for past week 
09/11/2013,Unusually hot and dry.  Water level dropped significantly
04/25/2014,Ice off.  water level low.  clear water
06/09/2014,suspended particles.  lots of floating pollen and globs of algae
07/22/2014,globs of algae floating
08/10/2014,some algae globs but much fewer
09/08/2014,some suspended algae and small particles after significant rain
09/12/2014,algae seems to have settled out and cleared
04/12/2015,Lowest water level in spring in many years
05/09/2015,Lots of floating globs of algae and plant gook (yes that is the scientific name I believe)
05/30/2015,algae present.  Had recent rain
07/05/2015,Water level has been fairly steady and would not be more normal for mid summer but still low.  Water is crystal clear
09/01/2015,Lake has been outstandingly clear all summer except for a short period the end of May.  Lake weeds are low and bottom is bare in large areas.  Large leaf pond weed is low with only some plants reaching the surface and not looking vibrant as in previous years.  Some clumps of what appear to be niaid are up.  Cattails are still back along shore but have not re-emerged much into the water.  Water lilies have taken residence where cattails used to be.  
04/24/2016,high water level
07/27/2016,Lots of weeds- some suspended algae
08/11/2016,suspended algae and some filamentous algae
