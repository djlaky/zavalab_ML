07/09/1998,Water plants now growing on dry land.    
07/24/1998,Windy last 3 days.    
08/10/1998,3 inches of rain past week.    
08/26/1998,Lake level remains low unless beavers return.  Persons continue to destroy the beaver dams built in the lake outlet resulting in low water level.  I fear another fish kill this winter.    
05/01/1999,Ice out 04/07- bald eagle sighted today- one loon flew over the lake this A.M.    
05/27/1999,Rainfall above avg. in May- beaver dam is rebuilt as lake is holding water level high.    
06/25/1999,Avg rainfall thus far- some bass and bluegills still carrying eggs!    
07/08/1999,Very rainy + windy past week- probably cause for secchi reading- above average rain past 2 weeks.    
07/22/1999,Record rainfall for month of July.    
08/07/1999,Rain about every other day- low water level is result of beaver dam opening up.    
08/20/1999,Beaver have repaired their dam- water rising- cool august temp thus far.    
09/22/1999,Little precipitation month of sept. lake level remains constant. it appears that weed growth in the lake is rapidly increasing + should be a concern.    
05/18/2004,GRAB SAMPLE    
08/18/2004,DEEP HOLE - INTEGRATED SAMPLE    
07/22/2009,mostly clear; a little wind; saw kingfisher;family of geese in marsh area; helper was Bob Grobarchik; canoed to deep hole on lake.
08/10/2009,Breezy; partly cloudy;could see detritus floating in some areas.
08/24/2009,Little breezy- a few clouds- air temp about 75.
06/18/2010,Weather was sunny except for some high wispy clouds.  There was a little breeze.  Saw two bald eagles- one loon- one heron- one kingfisher.  Observed some plants in 7 feet of water.  Not sure what they were- but there was only a small area of them.
07/01/2010,Little wind; slightly wavy; light cirrus clouds; saw 2 loons.  Observed small patch of aquatic plants in deep area.  Collected milfoil for observation-determined it was a native species- not EWM.  No sign of detritus that plagued the lake last year at this time.  Small clump of floating chara noted.
07/29/2010,Sunny- few clouds. Breezy with light waves. 2 loons observed. 
The lake level has remained at about 7.9 on our staff gauge for at least 2 years- and vegetation has covered exposed shoreline.
