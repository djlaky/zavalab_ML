08/13/2015,It is a warm and very humid morning with a slight breeze and mainly cloudy skies. Water level is down to about what it was in May of this year. It went up a few inches during the spring and now- due to evaporation- the level is receeding again. Hopefully the fall rains will come and increase the level again. Surface water Temperature is 74.2- it was up to 79.7 a few weeks ago.

07/29/2016,We had rain earlier in the week which may have effected depth reading.

09/20/2016,66.5 degrees outside and partly cloudy- calm
05/13/2017,cool cloudy day- water temp at surface was 55 degrees F. Lake level is finally back to normal. I think it went up 10-12 inches during the winter and early spring.
06/09/2017,Looks like a lot of algae in the water plus pollen from trees. Surface water temp was 73 degrees F. Absolutely beautiful day- no wind lake was like glass- no clouds. Beaver have been very active around the entire lake. Quite a few eagles this year. This is about the highest I have seen the lake since the early 80's.
07/14/2018,Beautiful day- partly cloudy- absolutely no wind. Water Temp 82F. We had 1.8 inches of rain Thursday and there has been a lot of boating and jet ski activity on the lake this weekend.

10/10/2018,We have had over 4 inches of rain the last few days- it finally stopped so we went for a boat ride. We saw 3 loons- the pair on our lake had 2 young ones so we could not tell if we were missing one young one or one adult. Air temp was 49 with 99% humidity. Water temp was 53 degrees. No fish at all on the locator. 
06/29/2019,water temp 71degrees F  Water level is at an all time high. 
07/28/2019,Outside temp 67F  Water temp 79F Beautiful morning- no wind partly cloudy. A couple people fishing. I saw a crane flying from one shore to the other.
07/31/2019,Water Temp at 2 foot was 73 degrees F. Outside temp  is 57F but it was down to 48 at 5:30 this morning. Lake has not gone down at all since early spring. Every time it goes down an inch or so we get another storm with heavy downpours and it goes right back where it was in the spring. Very abnormal. Normally the lake is down by 6 inches or so by now from where it was in early spring.
Beautiful morning- no wind and clear skies absolutely beautiful. 
09/04/2019,water temp was 68 F Air temp 65 F Beautiful day- cool with a light breeze. Saw our two loons swimming and diving. Lake is very quiet now. 
09/15/2019,calm and cloudy. We saw 2 loons swimming and diving. Water temp was 63- Air temp was 66. We've had about 2.8 inches of rain in the last 3-4 days. A number of piers including the one at the boat launch now have the bottom of the decking touching the water. Some people have raised their piers 3 times this year. Water level is the heist ever.
06/24/2020,Beautiful day. Many trees down from the storm a couple weeks ago- some in the lake and others in the woods surrounding the lake. Water temp near the surface is 70 degrees F. Water level is again the highest it has ever been. Most lake owners have had to raise their docks again and earlier in the year there were some sections of the docks floating freely in the lake.

08/23/2020,Surface water temperature was 77F. Water although high was down about 3 inches from it's high point. The water clarity is a bit murky most likely due to the boat traffic on the weekend.
10/08/2020,Air temp was 59 and surface water temp was 58. Beautiful day- clear blue skies- light breeze. The colors are just a little past peak. We saw 2 loons
