natural plants. Marsh Merrigolds are in bloom.

    
06/07/2003,Water temp @ 4' is 66 degrees. CONCERN: We are seeing larger amount of fish die-off.  The turtles- birds and raccoon usually have kept the shoreline clean.  Fish show white- cotton like wound in area of body most likely not caused by hook.

06/10/2005,In my eight year experience of Horseshoe Lake- this is the clearest and deepest visual reading I have seen.  Last year was one of the LEAST clear. This year has had very little snow melt and spring rain run-off and last year had lots.  These two years dramatically demonstrate how much the run-off does affect our beautiful lake.
