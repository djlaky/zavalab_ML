Trout Lake Station HACH QW30D SN/130300085407 used for all June-July-August profile measurements in Lakes Minocqua and Kawaguesaga.

Samples mailed to DNR 7/11/16 particles noted floating in 30- sample. 
08/15/2016,John R. Gray and Regis Brost in Gray fishing boat.

Used Trout Lake Station HACH HQ30D S/N 130300085407 John R. Gray and Regis Brost in Gray fishing boat.

Used Trout Lake Station HACH HQ30D S/N 130300085407 DO/Temp profiler

Sunny and calm.

Took and shared 1' depth photo (also for Lake Minocoqua) for ChlA comparison- sent to DNR/Madison- ack'ed. 

No dead Cisco found (see Lake Minocqua observation earlier today). 

0-6 ft TP and ChlA samples. 

TP also at 15'.

TP and orthophosphate at 35 feet. No sediment in Van Dorn bottle. 
06/01/2017,John R. Gray and Regis Brost- no DO/temp profiler but with Orion Model 122 specific conductance meter:
s/n 0910176- top 6'- temp = 16.4 C- specific conductance = 126.0 micromhos/cm
s/n 0910093- top 6'- temp = 16.2 C- specific conductance = 125.7 micromhos/cm

See Minocqua Deep Hole similar measurements
06/27/2017,John R. Gray and Regis Brost in John's fishing boat- Trout Lake Station HACH 30d DO/temp profiler and Orion Model 122 specific conductance meter:
s/n 0910176- top 6'- temp = 20.4 C- specific conductance = 123.9 micromhos/cm
s/n 0910093- top 6'- temp = 20.3 C- specific conductance = 123.8 micromhos/cm

See Minocqua Deep Hole similar measurements
07/17/2017,John R. Gray and Regis Brost- Trout Lake Station/UW DO/temp profiler HACH 30d and Orion Model 122 specific conductance meter (one of two- no s/n recorded)- top 6'- specific conductance = 123.0 micromhos/cm

See Minocqua Deep Hole similar measurements today
09/24/2017,See subsequent Lake Minocqua Deep Hole measurements from same platform/using but failed to record Orion specific-conductance meter s/n 0910176 specific conductance...but it was around 127 umhos/cm from memory- or at least consistent with the slightly smaller values measured in 2017 at Minocqua Deep Hole. John R. Gray and Regis Brost from John's fishing boat (correct; not Regis pontoon for both measurements today). Gorgeous day. 
10/08/2017,John R. Gray- Darien Brost (also at Lake Minocqua measurements today) and Regis Brost from Regis' pontoon boat- some drifting (?). Orion specific-conductance and temp meter with ~8-foot cable s/n 0910176 near-surface measurements: SC = 127.3- temp 16.4 degrees C. 

Used CLMN temp probe with spooled cable- as with 9/24 measurements (after August- 2017- no longer borrowing Trout Lake Station DO/temp HACH HQ30D profiler). 
06/22/2018,Field work here and Lake Minocqua (at 1400+) today- June 22- by John R. Gray and Regis Brost (his last day of 2018 CLMN field work). Failed to retain a filterable sample for ChlA today (miscommunication between Regis and me) necessitates a second field trip to re-collect water sample for ChlA filtering- that done June 30- 2018. 

Used Orion specific conductance meter S/N0910176 for 4' depth SC = 121.8 micromhos/cm and temp 25.2 C. 

"Staff gauge" is Kawaguesaga Dam staff presumably referenced to MSL (datum?)- value 1584.9 ft. 

Used borrowed Trout Lake Station Hach HQ30D profiling meter for temp and DO profiles (DO profiles were measured on 3-foot intervals here and at Kawaguesaga each of June- July and August -- inquiries may be sent  via email to GraySedimentology@gmail.com   ). 
06/30/2018,Field work here and Lake Minocqua (at 1135- incorrectly listed as 1110...) today- Saturday- June 30- to re-collect top 6' water sample from Lake Kawaguesaga and filter for ChlA- this extra field work/sample necessitated by miscommunication between Regis Brost and collector John Gray (who did not accompany John on today's field work)

Used Orion specific conductance meter model 122- S/N0910176- for 4' depth SC = 121.8 micromhos/cm and temp 25.2 C. Air temp = 28

"Staff gauge" is Kawaguesaga Dam staff presumably referenced to MSL (datum?)- value 1584.78 (from 705 Cedar St. staff gauge referenced to Dam staff). 

Used borrowed Trout Lake Station Hach HQ30D profiling meter for temp and DO profiles (DO profiles were measured on 3-foot intervals here and at Kawaguesaga each of June- July and August -- inquiries may be sent  via email to GraySedimentology@gmail.com   ). 
07/22/2018,Field work here and Lake Minocqua (at 1330+) today- Saturday- June 30- to re-collect top 6' water sample from Lake Kawaguesaga and filter for ChlA- this extra field work/sample necessitated by miscommunication between Regis Brost and collector John Gray (who did not accompany John on today's field work)

Used Orion specific conductance meter S/N0910176 for 4' depth SC = 121.8 micromhos/cm and temp 25.2 C. 

"Staff gauge" is Kawaguesaga Dam staff presumably referenced to MSL (datum?)- value 1584.78 (from 705 Cedar St. staff gauge referenced to Dam staff).

08/23/2018,Field work here and Lake Minocqua (at 1345+) today- Thursday- Aug. 23- 2018. 

Used Orion specific conductance meter S/N0910176 for 4' depth SC = 125.0 micromhos/cm and temp 23.0 C. 

"Staff gauge" is Kawaguesaga Dam staff presumably referenced to MSL (datum?)- value 1584.5 (from 705 Cedar St. staff gauge referenced to Dam staff). 

Used borrowed Trout Lake Station Hach HQ30D profiling meter for temp and DO profiles (DO profiles were measured on 3-foot intervals here and at Kawaguesaga each of June- July and August -- inquiries may be sent  via email to GraySedimentology@gmail.com   ).
