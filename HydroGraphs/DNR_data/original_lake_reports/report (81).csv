The lake level is now 43.5 inches below the top of the standard pipe.  The lake has risen 14 inches since June 9- 2014.  This is the highest lake level in the past 25 years.  

The sky was overcast when I did my Secchi disc reading today so the observation may not be quite right.

I saw a muskrat swim by while making my observations.  That's the first muskrat I've seen in about 5 years.  
09/01/2014,Partly cloudy today.   Rainy weather continues.  We had .75 inches of rain since my observations of August 30- 2014.  That makes 4.25 inches of rain in the past five days.  We've had 10.85 inches of rain since June 9- 2014.

We had 1.15 inches of rain overnight and we've had 2.25 inches of rain since September 20.  

I checked the level of the standard pipe today and the level of my measurement spot on my steps.  There is now a difference of 14.5 inches between the two.  I previously calculated that difference at 12.5 inches.  Perhaps one or both have moved a bit and perhaps my previous measurement wasn't accurate.  In any case- the current lake level is 42.0 inches below the top of the standard pipe near the Ulfert cabin.  That's 8.5 inches lower than the April 2015 reading.  

According to my measurements- there is now only .2 degrees F difference between the water temp at the surface and the temp on the lake bottom.   There was a difference of 20 degrees F in July.

I determined that our new lower deck is 7 inches below the standard pipe.  So- when measuring with my one-inch high laser level- I only need to add 6 inches.  I also established a pipe that is 1.5 inches lower than the standard pipe.  When using the laser level- my pipe is.5 inches lower.

06/17/2019,Overcast with a gentle breeze.  I collected a water sample today and delivered it to the Danbury Post Office.
It has been cool lately.  That may explain why the surface temperature of the late has dropped at a time in the season when the temperature usually rises.  
07/01/2019,Overcast and calm today.  The lake level has returned to -40.0 inches.  That's the level it was at on May 28- the first monitoring session of 2019.  We've had 2.0 inches of rain since June 17 and the lake has risen 1.5 inches since then.
There is an algae bloom on the lake at this time.  I think there are two types of algae- including a filamentous algae of some kind.  I don't recall seeing that type of algae and I don't recall seeing any significant algae bloom in the month of June.  
07/02/2019,Sunny and calm today.  The algae bloom of last couple of days seems to changing somewhat.  The filamentous algae has either disappeared or modified into thicker clumps.  Some sort of combination of pollen and algae has turned the water to green.  Nonetheless- today Secchi disc reading and all of the reading thus far this year exceed the clearest readings of 2018. We've had a trace amount of rain since yesterday and the lake level remains at -40.0 inches.

The lake level is 37.5 inches below the standard pipe today.  That's the highest lake level of the monitoring season but below the record high lake level of September 2016.
09/27/2019,This will be the final monitoring session of 2019.    It's chilly and overcast today.   I didn't do a Secchi disc reading today because it was too dark and too late in the day.

That's 5.25 inches higher than the lake level at the first monitoring session of 2019 on May 28- 2019.  This was the highest lake level reading of 2019 and the highest lake level since September of 2017. 
10/14/2019,It has been rainy lately so I measured the lake level one more time.  
The lake is now 33.0 inches below the top of the standard pipe.  
That is up 1.75 inches from 9/27/2014 and up 7.0 inches from the first measurement this year on May 28- 2019.   
The lake level is at its highest point in the last two years.
This reading is only 8.5 inches below the all-time high measurement of September 24- 2016.
04/25/2020,First lake monitoring session of 2020.  Somewhat windy today- cloudy- and about 62 degrees.  The lake level is a bit higher than it was in October 2019.  The lake level is 32 inches below the standard pipe.  This may be the highest reading since the all-time high lake level of September 2016.   Loons- mergansers- geese- eagles- red-wing blackbirds- and crows on and around the lake.  Lots of cow birds at our bird feeder. 
04/26/2020,Sunny today with a gentle breeze and 59 degrees F.  
05/20/2020,Gentle breeze today and 70 degrees F.  
05/24/2020,Breezy and overcast today.  The lake remains at -31.5 inches- a very high level.    Secchi disc reading today of 10.5 feet.  
05/27/2020,Calm today and partly cloudy.   We had 2.8 inches of rain since 5/24/2020 and the lake level rose 2.5" as a result.  The lake level is now 29.0 inches below the standard pipe.  That's not a record high reading but it is one of the highest ever.  There was a thick layer of yellow pollen on the lake shore today.  Mayflies are starting to emerge.  
05/31/2020,Sunny and windy today.  There has been no rain since 5/27/2020 and the lake level has dropped 1.0 inch since then.   Pollen is everywhere.  Mayflies are abundant.  It was unseasonably cold last night and the surface temperature of the lake has dropped just a bit as a result.  
06/14/2020,Sunny and windy today.  We've had .7 inches of rain since 05/31/2020.  The lake has dropped 1.5 inches since then to 31.5 inches below the standard pipe.  
06/19/2020,Overcast today with a gentle breeze.  We've had 1/16" of rain since 6/14/2020 and the lake level has fallen .5 inch to 32.0 inches below the standard pipe.  Secchi disc today of 17.0 feet which is the same as the last two readings.  
06/22/2020,Mostly sunny today with a gentle wind.  We've had only a trace of rain since 06/19/2020 and the lake level has dropped 1/4" to 32.25 inches below the standard pipe.  I sampled the lake water today for the Wisconsin DNR.
07/11/2020,Calm today and partly cloudy.   The weather has been hot lately and the surface lake temperature has increased significantly to 80.6 degrees F.  The Secchi disc reading today was 17.0 feet which is the same as every reading since 05/31/2020.  We've had 3.25 inches of rain since 06/22/2020.  The lake level has risen 2.25 inches since then to 30.5 inches below the standard pipe.  
07/15/2020,Mostly cloudy today with a gentle breeze.  We've had .4 inches of rain since 07/11/2020 and the lake level has dropped by .25 inches since then.  The lake level is 30.25 inches below the standard pipe.  
07/20/2020,Cloudy and calm today.  We've had 1.25 inches of rain since 07/15/2020 and the lake level has dropped .25 inches since then.  The lake level is 30.5 inches below the standard pipe.  The Secchi disc reading today with calm water was 18.5 feet.
07/29/2020,Partly cloudy today with a gentle breeze.  We've had 1.7 inches of rain since 07/20/2020 and the lake level has dropped .25 inches to 30.25 inches below the top of the standard pipe. The Secchi disc reading today was 14.0 feet.
08/03/2020,Overcast and breezy today.  We've had .2 inches of rain since 07/29/2020 and the lake level has dropped .5 inches since then to 30.75 inches below the top of the standard pipe.  
08/08/2020,Overcast today and breezy.  We've had .3 inches of rain since 08/03/2020.  The lake level has dropped .35" since then.  The lake level is currently 31.1 inches below the standard pipe.  
08/17/2020,Sunny today and breezy.  We've had 2.1 inches of rain since 08/08/2020 and the lake level has risen 1.15 inches since then.  The lake level is currently -30.25" below the top of the standard pipe.  
08/27/2020,Partly cloudy today and breezy.  We've had .1 inches of rain since 08/17/2020 and the lake level has fallen since then 1.25 inches to 31.5 inches below the top of the standard pipe.  So- the lake level is now back to where it was the first time I measured the lake level in 2020 (April 23).  The Secchi disc reading today was 15.5 feet so the water is currently very clear for this late in the summer season.
09/03/2020,Overcast and extremely windy today.   It was so windy that my anchor wouldn't hold the boat in place so I wasn't able to gather temperature and water clarity data.   The lake level today was .5 inches lower than the first reading of 2020.  It's now 32.0 inches below the standard pipe.  We've had 1.5 inches of rain since 8/27/2020.
09/13/2020,Overcast today and breezy.  We've had .3 inches of rain since 09/03/2020.  The lake level has dropped 1.5" since then to 33.5" below the top of the standard pipe.  It has been unseasonably cold this past week and the lake temperatures are dropping quickly.  Maple trees along the lakeshore are already turning stunning shades of red and orange.  
09/18/2020,Clear skies today and just a hint of wind.  It was unseasonably cold last night (28 degrees F).  There has been no rain since 09/13/2020.  The lake level has dropped .5 inches since then.  The lake level is currently 34" below the top of the standard pipe at the Eastern boundary of the public landing park.   That's the lowest lake level I have noted this summer season.  This was my last monitoring session of 2020.   The water temperature at the top and the bottom are currently within one degree F of each other.
