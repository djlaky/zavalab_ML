06/11/2016,Warm weather (upper 80's) slight breeze w clear sunshine most of day. Humid weather for three days. Rains have missed this area past few days. 
07/04/2016,Additional lake association members were present to observed and participate in the sampling and testing. Found it educational and enjoyed the activity.  Observers: Jean Medzis and Bill Evans.
WEATHER: Mostly sunny with partial cloud activity. Light breeze from Southeast at 8-10 mph. 3-5" small waves. air temperature 81 F
Paired loons with one chick swimming and short dive attempts by the young loon. Several eagles and Ospreys

08/28/2016,Overcast with occasional clearing skies. Slight breeze from SE at 6-8 mph. 4-6" wave action. Past few days have mild steady temperatures- with on/off light rain and overcast skies. 
07/05/2018,Performed Secchi Disc reading to coordinate with satellite Path 26. Secchi reading 8.50 feet.  
07/13/2018,Secchi Disk only to coordinate with Satellite Path 26 
07/21/2018,Secchi  Disk reading only to coordinate with Satellite Path 26
07/29/2018,Secchi Disk reading only to coordinate with Satellite Path 26
08/31/2018,SE wind approximately 8-10 mph. Thin cloud cover provided bright lighting (shadows were produced). Recent heavy rains and thunderstorms resulting in some runoff from shorelines.  Time 1000-1300 for equipment cleaning and drying- rope drying.

06/28/2019,Also had Bill Evans to observe and assist both "on-water" and "shore" procedures. Was not able to add him to the list of data collectors. Dorothy Moe stated that a few of the lake residents had observed fish dead and floating on surface of water.
07/22/2019,Today: Mostly Sunny Temps in the low 70's heading to the upper 70's. Wind WNW @ 5-7 mph occasional gusts @9-10 mph . Light wave action @ 4-6". Starting to see algae growth suspended in water. Water and Air temps have been warm. Recent rain storms with strong winds may be contributing. 
Curlyleaf Pondweed is visibly brown and floating near water-surface.
Several Loon pairs with 2 chicks each. Younger loons have changed from brown downy color to more white and lighter tones. Young eagles are in flight at low-levels.   A.Medzis
08/19/2019,Time 10:30 - 14:30 Hours. Equipment maintenance and delivery to USPS.
Assisted by William Evans- noticeably more algae suspension present in the water. Curlyleaf Pondweed appears to be dieing off as more plants are turning brown. Slight breeze out of the SSW- with dryer air present. 
08/25/2019,Secchi Disk reading ONLY: Coordinated with Satelite program.
08/16/2020,Wavy- westerly winds- clear skies
Bill Evans accompanied and assisted with water column temperature testing- water sample collection and secchi disk measurements. Then on-shore paperwork- chemistry and chlorophyll sampling was conducted with the additional assistance of Bob and Dorothy Moe.  Equipment was then taken to shore and prepared for drying prior to being stored.
