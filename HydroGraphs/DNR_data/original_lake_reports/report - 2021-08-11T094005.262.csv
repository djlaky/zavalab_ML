08/23/1979,Migrated from EPA STORET Legacy Database- originally reported by Wisconsin DNR    
05/05/2004,DEEP HOLE - GRAB SAMPLE    
08/11/2004,DEEP HOLE - INTEGRATED SAMPLE    
08/05/2014,Trip with Richard Kohn and Sandy Wickham on a mild sunny day.  The lake shoreline is 6-12" higher than last year- but still low compared to the "normal" vegetation and indentations of years past.  There is increased aquatic plant life (approx. doubled from last year) and algae in the large western bay of the lake- as well as in some spots around the shore of the body of the lake.  "Green Cloud" algae has been visible in the bay at times- but is not obvious today.
08/27/2014,Weather partly cloudy- cool.    Co-collector of data was Richard H. Kohn. Weather partly cloudy- cool.    Co-collector of data was Richard H. Kohn. Lake remains only slightly lower than indentations and stones at "normal" level of many years ago- so it is higher than it has been in many years.
06/09/2015,Lake level looks slightly lower than last year (a few inches?).  The day was partly cloudy.  I was assisted by my husband Dick Kohn.  
08/15/2015,Bright sun.  Lake level is really down--about 12 ft. out from original water line (many years ago).  It is probably 6 to 8 feet out from last year (our shore is shallow- so I don't know the actual water level drop.)  In weedy areas- weeds are prolific.  Algae less than last year (subjective- from memory.)  Deep water still seems very unspoiled- but warmer.
09/05/2016,Day was partly cloudy and quite wavy.  Disk kept going under boat.  I recorded water level as normal because the level was at historic high level at beginning of summer and now is down slightly from that level.  It is higher than it has been in many years.  Weather has been rainy.
07/17/2020,Beautiful day with some breeze- but bright sun.  Lake water has been much warmer in general this summer.  Lots of algae in the bay (3-6 feet).
09/07/2020,Overcast sky- windy- choppy waves.  Cold.
