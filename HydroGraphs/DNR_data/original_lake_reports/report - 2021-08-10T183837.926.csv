6/26/2018,Air; 72 degrees. Cloudy w/strong SE wind. With only one loon foraging on the lake- it could be that the other member of Alva's pair could be on the nest (which has been very difficult to locate though we know it's in marshy SW bay). ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7/9/2018,Air:64 degrees. Water: 78.8 degrees. Sunshine w/light SW breeze. A wonderful summer day made better because we now have two chicks with their parents now cruising the lake.   ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8/1/2018,Air:78.3. Rain showers / light WNW breeze. (a drippy day to be on the lake but- it was the only day the oxygen meter was available). The rain today follows a recent dry spell that has caused the lake level to drop by about two inches but- the level remains at an all time high. The two loon parents and their chicks continue to forage on the lake and- if all goes well weather wise- the two chicks and their un-banded mother will be banded later this week. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8/19/2018,Air: 72 degrees. Water: 77 degrees. Hazy sunshine ( probably caused by western and Canadian fires ) w/light SE wind. Loon chicks have been banded and continue to grow. Unfortunately- their mother could not be captured and remains un-banded. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The weather has been very changeable from day to day and now snow is in the forecast for tomorrow (even though many leaves are still on the trees). Because the high winds have made it difficult to spot any loons on the lake at least one immature ""voice"" has been heard a number of times.

7/1/2019,Air: 73 degrees. Hazy sunshine with wind from the southwest. Finally- summer is here with warmer temperatures. Three loons are on the lake today which leaves us wondering if the nest has been abandoned and an intruder is about to take advantage of the situation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6/28/2020,"Air temp.: 77 degrees. Sunshine w/light SW breeze. With more than abundant rainfall this spring- the woods are more green than we have seen in many years. Unfortunately- the rains have further increased  the lake level causing many more shoreline trees to ""have their feet wet"" leading to the death of many of them. Air temp.: 77 degrees.
