09/01/2019,72 degrees- partly sunny- light breeze.  Water level continues to rise weekly due to unprecedented rainfall.

No shorelines anywhere- trees standing in water all long shore- channel between Beaulieu and Koonz lakes no longer defined.  Island on Beaulieu has completely disappeared underwater.  Also heard from full-time residents that there was a major fish die-off over the past winter due to severe decrease in water oxygen levels.  Noticed very few fish during outing - mostly small schools of minnows- a couple of bluegill- one crappie.  Several turtles were sunning themselves on partially submerged fallen trees.  Did not see loons.
07/05/2020,87 degrees- hazy sun- light breeze.  Water brown and very churned up.  Pair of loons swimming/diving.  Heard from full-time residents that their two eggs were destroyed by predators :(  Lake remains at highest level we have seen.
