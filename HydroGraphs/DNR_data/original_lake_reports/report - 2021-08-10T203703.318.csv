EWM + decomposing filamentous algae; 10-15 MPH west winds with 10% cumulus cloud cover; seasonable weather with rain yesterday; traffic on lake was heavy - a Sunday at 81 degrees F air temperature; samples for Chlorophyll and Phosphate sent to lab.
06/24/2013,Landsat; pH=7.2; very few fish between 11'-13'; much decomposing debris from EWM- Bladderwort- filamentous algae- etc.; EWM becoming very dense - not green but unhealthy - weed treatment is scheduled for tomorrow 06/25/13; no ducks or geese observed; winds from the south at 5-10 MPH with 90% cumulus cloud cover; air feels warm and humid at 79 degrees F; lake traffic had 2 water skiers.
07/02/2013,Landsat; pH=6.3; my son Scott Stroessner assisted in monitoring; few fish between 11'-13'; EWM sprayed 1 week ago - much gray to brown EWM- but some had more green than expected; no ducks or geese seen; abundance of Sago Pondweed and Common Broadleaf Pondweed;  northeast winds at 10-15 MPH at 72 degrees F air temperature which felt cool and dry for July 2nd; 99% cumulus/stratus cloud cover; there were 3 boats- 1 skier + 1 tuber. 
07/10/2013,Landsat; pH=6.8; fish between 11'-19'; EWM still abundant east of Bear's property; no Curly Leaf Pondweed could be found until an "all alert" call was sent out to all Random Lake Association members who had email addresses.  Finally a couple of plants were found in the channel at the northwest end of the lake. Former yellow lily pads are being joined by white blossoms; no ducks or geese seen; most other EWM is greatly reduced. Chlorophyll and Phosphate samples sent to lab; north/northwest winds were at 15-20 MPH with 50% cumulus cloud cover with air temperature at 72 degrees F and some recent rain; only 1 water skier. 
07/18/2013,Landsat; monitored with neighbor - Tom Dumez; pH=7.1; fish between 11'-19'; 7 adult Canada Geese with 2 goslings seen at public pier; EWM not found from beach to Bear's property- but much dying EWM along Taylor's + Mayer's property; cattails still immature; more white lily pad blossoms; appearance of Planktothrix rubescens (blue-greens) in form of dark- slimy- 4 to 5 centimeter spherical "globs" floating at the surface - John Masterson- DNR in Plymouth- checked them out under his microscope - usually locate nearer to shore; WSW winds at 10 MPH and 86 degrees F made air warm; sky with O% cloud cover but some haze; it rained yesterday.  Water surface temperature was 87 degrees F- warmest of this summer. 
07/26/2013,Landsat; pH=7.2; fish between 6'-18'; EWM no longer at Taylor's or Mayer's property - either the recent spray job killed them or the high temperature put them into dormancy.  Monitoring got rained out so data were from testing while lowing the probe only!  100% Cumulo-Nimbus clouds that cut monitoring short;  it was seasonably cool at only 70 degrees F; traffic included 1 jet skier- 1 fishing boat and 1 pontoon; lake surface temperature back down to 76 degrees F; 70 degrees F southern winds at 5 MPH ushered in the rain.
08/03/2013,Landsat; pH=7.0; many fish between 10'-19'; first time that lake water appears green; some 3 to 5-cm diameter dark spherical globs of dead debris containing Planktothrix rubescens (Blue-Green); much dead EWM floating; only one live EWM plant at Mayer's; cattails immature; no ducks or geese seen; 10 MPH northwest wind at 72 degrees F air temperature; seasonably cool with some recent rain; several jet skis and other watercraft. 
08/11/2013,Landsat; pH=7.3; Janet Eisenhut who volunteered to monitor next year assisted with monitoring; fish between 8'-19'; no visible live EWM anywhere; Sego plant numbers reduced; a few dark globs floating and decomposing; Chlorophyll and Phosphate samples were sent to the lab; 63 degrees F light SE winds at 0-5 MPH are seasonably cool with 100% cumulo-nimbus clouds; traffic includes 1 tuber- kayaks and fishermen. 
08/19/2013,Landsat; pH=7.2; fish between 6'-19'; several dark blobs floating (Planktothrix rubescens); some fresh Northern Milfoil and Common Bladderwort; no geese or ducks- but geese very abundant in early morning; reeds brown at top half; EWM mostly dormant at fishery otherwise there was none; SSW winds at 5-10 MPH with 50% cumulus clouds and some haze; air temperature at 79 degrees F with seasonable weather; traffic included 2 watercraft- 1 fisherman- 1 tuber and several swimmers.
08/27/2013,Landsat; pH=7.3; many fish between 7'-19'; no ducks or geese seen; many sea gulls; lily pads mostly white at northwest end; no "tails" on cattails yet; EWM very sparse; surface has improved with very little floating debris or pollen; 83 degrees F wind out of the SSW at 5-10 MPH; 10% light cirrus cloud cover with some haze; seasonably warm with 100 degrees F predicted for today; only one fisherman and several swimmers; 
09/04/2013,Landsat; pH=7.3; many fish between 10'-19'; 4 geese near library; EWM reappearing at public pier- Taylor's + Mayer's; 3 entire milfoil plants floating in a cluster at site #1 (Deep Hole) - 2 were Northern Milfoil 1 was green EWM; light NNW winds at 5-10 MPH; recent weather is seasonable with 73 degrees F air temperature; sky with 25% cirrus clouds. 
09/13/2013,Day after Landsat; pH=7.2; many fish between 9'-19'; geese actively flying in V formation; EWM is re-establishing at public pier- DeLuca's- Mayer's- Taylor's- swimming area- at end of "point" and along fish reserve; lily pads no longer blooming; many sea gulls; NE winds 10-15 MPH with 15% cumulus cloud cover; variable weather with some rain; quiet lake traffic with only 1 fisherman.
10/02/2013,Not a Landsat day; pH=7.4; fish between 8'-18'; EWM abundant at Mayer's. Taylor's and empty lot - otherwise mostly scattered; no lily pad blossoms; maple leaves turning red; no ducks or geese; warm (70 degrees F) dry light breeze from east at 0-5 MPH with 1% jet vapor trails in the sky; no lake traffic except pontoon at end of monitoring.  No Zebra mussels all year - not on Zebra mussel traps nor anywhere else.  Also all year long- the prior nuisance Planktothrix rubescens limited itself only in the dark 4 to 5-cm diameter globs - some weeks- especially warm water- there were more than other weeks.  Evidently the goose egg oil treatment was very effective again this year.  There were no small goslings seen all summer.  The larger goslings that were seen were probably from nests beyond our shoreline.
06/01/2014,Moderate boat traffic- partly sunny and warm day (78 deg F.)- wind from south @ 9 mph.

Jeff Eisenhut- husband- recorded DO/temperature readings.
06/22/2014,Heavy rain over past week- cooler temperatures than normal.  Noted more submerged vegetation.  Lake quiet- fishing boats only.

Jeff Eisenhut- husband- recorded DO + lake temperature data.
07/13/2014,Moderate boat traffic- partly cloudy day- rain prior evening.  Partly cloudy and cooler day.  Surface algae.  

Lake pesticide treatment (DMA-4-IVM) on 7/9.  Permit to treat 60 acres (of 209) for Eurasian milfoil.

Jeff Eisenhut- husband- recorded DO + lake temperature data.
08/15/2014,Light boat traffic. Sunny day (0% cloud cover) and warm (78 deg. F.) and wind at 2 mph.  Rain during prior week.

Little surface algae.  Boat drifted from deep hold which may account from some differrent DO/temp. readings- however water temperature warmer than prior year.

Calibrated digital meter prior to readings.  Rachel Sabre (WDNR) recorded DO and lake temperature data and helped with techniques and samples.
