Start Date,Fieldwork Comment
02/08/2005,with Martin Billings--sample taken through hole in ice-covered lake
07/01/2008,Sunny- 80's and breezy  Reesa Evans accompanied us.
08/11/2008,slightly breezy- sunny- temps in hi 70's
Barb + Larry took readings- blue heron spotted on NW corner of lake
09/17/2008,Not a cloud in the sky- mid 70's- and a bit breezy.  Only (1) fisherman on the lake.  Turtles only in the shallows.
05/15/2009,Cloudy- breezy.  Reesa Evans attended with us.  Spotted (4)nesting sandhill cranes.  Due to weather conditions clarity of lake visibility for plant species was limited to near shorelines.  Unable to locate any invasives  at this time.
06/25/2009,91' Wind: at 5 MPH
Humidity: 57%
Dewpoint: 71 degrees F
Barometer: 29.81 inches and steady
Heat Index: 93 degrees F
No other boaters on lake.  Variable pondweeds are beginning to break surface on the Eastern portion of lake (less invasive than last yr at this time.)  Lily pad blooms are barely existent - appear to be encroaching the navigational channel between the North and South portions of the lake more so than last year.  There were no exotic species (plant or animal) spotted.  Nice size muskrat was under pier closest to launch by our zebra mussel trap.  Extreme clarity of water made visibilty of many more fish than normal.  Schools of feeders- minnow and small perch were observed profusely.
07/28/2009,fairly breezy- air temp 62.  (1) blue heron on NW shoreline.  no other boats on lake.  did note that the former non invasive pond weed issue on NE portion of lake had subsided greatly.  most were no longer observed above water.  there were several floating weed masses on the southern end of lake which might have been from the previous nights high winds and rain.
08/31/2009,76' bright calm day.  charo has dropped from surface in navigation channel.  blue heron spotted on southeast portion of lake.  checked our traps for zebra mussels- noted much algae on the south lake trap and a few tiny brown snails on the northern trap (by launch).  lake was very calm with only one canoe on water.
05/28/2010,Sunny- breezy- Hi 70's- Chara appears closer to surface than last year.  An abundance of yellow water lily are about to open.  No sandhill crane nests observed.  Fish appear to be plentiful- saw many schools of panfish- bass and perch.  Surface of lake covered with pollen from trees.  (2) fishermen out on lake.  Looks as if we will need to clear a part of the navigation channel from the north to south portion of lake.  Many thick woody roots popping up above surface making navigation severely difficult.  Lily fields encroaching upon center of channel.  Saw garbage in lake bottom- removed soda cans- plastic bags.  Never had seen any garbage in prior years could this be due to the Fisheree held here this winter 
06/28/2010,Sunny- breezy low 70's.  Only (1) fisherman out on waters- (1) crane still on nest- turtle activity.  Observed Eurasian mil-foil near launch.
07/26/2010,88'    slight wind     excessive amount of charra thru out the narrows and on the nw side of lake.
09/01/2010,overcast with a very slight breeze- no other people on water.  Temp about 74 degrees .  Checked zebra muscle traps- only NON invasive snails attached to launch location trap.  Removed from water.  Lake waters were noted farther up into the wetlands than normal- also new flowering plant life was witnessed (will research later.)  No wildlife spotted and only white lily pad flowers were apparent.
06/16/2011,75' partly overcast- slight breeze.  Ron Luebke drove boat.
07/13/2011,sunny with breezes.  white water lily blooms in abundance.  chara infestation in narrows will soon impede navigation.  wetlands closest to our home have small clusters of wild grapes and many different types of vegetation with onset of berries.  absence of turtles sunning.
09/07/2011,Bright sunny day- slight breeze 70".  Charo is significantly down- no trouble navigating channel.  Water appears slightly less clear with more of a brown tinge to it.
04/04/2012,sunny + windy--but beautiful and quiet
07/11/2014,Shirly Schultz + B. Flentye also participated--warm- overcast- slight wind
08/07/2014,warm- sunny- slight wind--Shirley Schultz also participated
08/08/2014,Shirley Schultz also participated--warm- sunny- slight wind
04/14/2015,beautiful- quiet- kind of windy--water looks unusually murky for Crooked Lake--maybe from high winds yesterday and rain earlier this week--air tempt 69.2 F
06/25/2015,Shirley Schultz also participating
07/17/2015,Shirley Schultz also participating
08/24/2015,Shirley Schultz also participating
03/22/2016,air temp in mid 40s F--no one else on the lake--no sign of aquatic plant growth yet
07/02/2017,cloudy
