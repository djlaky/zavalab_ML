07/01/2007,Sunny- calm- air temp = 75 F. Green algae bloom uniform- poor water clarity.  State Park and Campground- homes along shore.  pH = 9.30; surface temp = 76.4 F; btm temp at 12' = 64.6 F. Surface D.O = 12.5. { PO4 = 0.1; NO3 = 0.1; NH3 = 0.1; Alk = 180; Chloride = 40;  TDS = 140 (ea in mg/L)}; Cond. = 0.21 m/S
04/09/2009,Called and had aerators turned on for Mirror Lake- due to the low oxygen readings.
05/12/2009,Lake is unusually clear.
08/05/2009,Sunny- calm- 70F. Sampling point at bluff along narrows- bottom depth = 10 ft.pH= 8.00; conductivity=0.23 uS/cm; TDS= 150 mg/L; PO4 (Chemet) less than 0.1 mg/L; alkalinity= 100 mg/L. Dense floating mats of algae common.  Species present: Spirogyra and oscillatoria.
03/09/2013,Through hole in ice.
05/07/2013,Collected water sample to send to UWSP.
