Results - conductivity: 24.2 uS/cm- pH: 6.92- alkalinity: 6.52 mg/L- calcium: 15.9 mg/L- magnesium: 5.86 mg/L- hardness: 63.9 mg/L- lead: ND- mercury: ND.   
05/14/2018,Eagles have built a new nest in a different tree on "Virgin Island".  Sample collection assisted by Gary Gruca. Ice out was May 6.
06/23/2018,Lake level very high from last weekends storms.  The area received 7" of rain from June 14-18. Water has brown stained appearance and the secchi reading has dropped.  The two observed loon nests on the lake were flooded and abandoned (4 eggs total).

08/31/2018,Breezy - hard to hold boat over deep hole
04/28/2019,Ice out was April 24.  Sample collection assisted by Gary Gruca
05/29/2019,Lake water is extremely high and as a result the lake water has a slight yellow tint.
07/04/2019,Not an ideal day for secchi due to clouds and light chop.  Water is murkier than usual due to high precipitation.  Assited by Margaret Behr 
07/29/2019,Two eagles hatched and now flying.  Observed the two eaglets and two adults near the nest.
06/09/2020,Ice Out was April 27.  Satellite Day.  Data collection was closely observed by one loon and one mature eagle.
06/25/2020,Satellite day.Observed two loons and a mature eagle.
07/01/2020,Temp and DO measured with PITLC Prosolo DO meter.  Observed two adult eagles and a loon.
07/04/2020,Secchi reading taken by Rick Wollerman
07/11/2020,satellite day.  Assisted by Margaret Behr.  Secchi  reading maybe be effected by Mayfly hatch.  Two adult eagles and three loons.  
08/30/2020,Two adult eagles and one immature eagle.  Assisted by Margaret Behr.
