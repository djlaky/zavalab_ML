07/20/2008,Slight NW breeze- 68 degrees- rain showers at 5:30 this AM- partly cloudy.  Yesterday- much boat traffic causing very large waves hitting the shoreline and causing erosion.  Water dirty around shoreline.  At test location- alot of algae and other particulate in the water column.
07/27/2008,SW slight breeze- 63 degrees- clear sky- sunny.  Algae is very evident in water column.  A great deal of boat traffic the day before causing much shoreline erosion. 
08/03/2008,Sunny with slight SE breeze- 68 degrees- Very heavy large boat traffic day before- alot of algae present with surface debre in calm bay areas.  Continued shoreline erosion due to large wave action as evidenced by the dirty water along the shore.  The seagulls have returned.
08/17/2008,Partly cloudy- slight W wind- 67 degrees- algae present on surface in calm areas. Partly cloudy- slight W wind- 67 degrees- algae present on surface in calm areas. User perception scale has been changed in the system by the DNR and therefore does not match prior reporting scale.  Using the prior 1 to 5 (the best to worst) scale which was started in April this collector would reflect the quality to be 4.   
08/24/2008,Clear sky- sunny- NW wind at about 3-5 mph- 56 degrees.  Very little rain the past week so lake level is down relative to previous weeks.  Much boat traffic on Saturday causing large waves however they are breaking well before the shore line so not as much shoreline erosion as when lake level was higher.  Clarity is visibly improved from prior weeks test but one can still see very small particles (algae) in the water column.  Seagulls are present in large numbers in the late afternoon and evening hours.
08/31/2008,Clear sky- winds calm- 72 degrees- many feathers on the lake surface from the thousands of seagulls.  Still very fine particulate in the water column.  
09/07/2008,Partly cloudy- 54 degrees- light SW winds- very fine particulate suspended in the water.  Partly cloudy- 54 degrees- light SW winds- very fine particulate suspended in the water.  Long steady light rain 2 days ago- amounting to about 3/4 inches.
09/21/2008,Surface very dirty looking with feathers- floating sticks- etc.  There are still very fine particles suspended in the water.  Partly cloudy- sunny- temperature 60 degrees with slight NE wind.
10/17/2008,Cloudy- calm winds- 45 degrees-  some seagulls on the lake- a few ducks also.
04/18/2009,Partly cloudy- winds calm- 2 Loons on lake - 65 degrees.
05/03/2009,Clear sky- sunny- winds calm- 55 degrees.  Saw one loon in the water near Ostoff.  Water appears clear with very fine particulate suspended in the water.
05/10/2009,Partly cloudy- winds calm- heavy rain on previous Friday nite. Partly cloudy- slight breeze
05/17/2009,Sunny-  calm winds
05/31/2009,Clear sky- SE winds
06/11/2009,Partly cloudy- slight breeze from NE- alot of what appeared to be the shed remenants of some type of hatching.  
06/21/2009,Cloudy- SE winds- 79 degrees- many boats previous day.  Lake looks very clear.
07/05/2009,Partly cloudy- Slight NW breeze- particlulate suspended in water column.
07/13/2009,More particulate in water column-  suspended algae very small along with larger particles.
07/19/2009,Suspended particles appear larger than last week and more algae present. White part of disc at 3 feet is starting to appear greenish.
08/02/2009,Clear sky- sunny- 56 degrees- slight wind out of the west.  Algae particulate 1 to 2 mm in size clearly visible in the water column.  Seagulls are back in the evening hours with the flock sure to grow in numbers.   
08/09/2009,Clear sky-  slight breeze out of W- warm humid temps.  Particulate present in water column.
08/19/2009,Clear sky- 63 degrees- no wind.  Small school of minnows out in middle of deep hole.
09/04/2009,Clear sky- no wind- lake calm- 60 degrees.  Very fine particulate in water column- seagull feathers floating.   Lake looks murky green at 5 to 10 feet deep.
09/27/2009,Light westerly breeze- 56 degrees- sunny to partly cloudy skies.  Seagulls and some small ducks present.  
06/26/2010,Winds calm- partly cloudy- 70 degrees.   A great deal of algae in the water column and floating on the surface.  Also- large clumps of green slim as I call it- not sure of the technical name for it.  Have had a large amount of rain in the last week and  the lake level is up substantially.  Boat wave action on the shoreline is significant causing much erosion.
07/04/2010,SW winds- 70 degrees- very much algae in the water column- noticable algae floating on the surface in the calm bays.  First seaglls about a week ago.
07/11/2010,Winds slight out of SW.  Clear sky- hot 80's.  Lake has taken on a greenish color- with visible algae clumps in calm bays along the shoreline.  Visible algae in the water column.
07/25/2010,Sunny- winds calm.  200+ seagulls.  Water is really not appealing.  Had much rain this month and 2 inches in just the last 2 days.  Much  green algae and suspended particles and strings of algae in water column.  Bubbles floating on surface and when looking at the surface water there appears to be a layer of film- such as if one would spill gas or oil in the lake.  In twenty plus years this in the worst condition of the lake seen by this observer.   Shore line erosion is very evident with large waves created by boating when water levels are very high.
