06/28/2018,On June 16 + 17- the lake was flooded with 12.2 inches of rain and significant water from other sources that normally do not run off into the lake.  The lake rose 4 feet from its normal level- flooding the area shoreline.  Today the lake is still high but the level is about 3.5 feet below the height of June 17 -20.
06/28/2018,On June 17 and 18 Lake Minnesuing experienced 12.2 inches of rain.  This rain caused significant flooding and a rise in the lake level.  The lake rose more than 4 feet as a result of this heavy rainfall.  With the high lake levels there was runoff from other sources and the lake rose onto yards and other areas that do not usually drain into the lake.  The lake continues high but the level has decreased about 3.5 feet.  Water quality might have been affected by this flooding.  There seemed to small particles in the lake that are not normally present.  The particles looked like dirt and small pieces of debris.

07/16/2019,The lake was very calm today.  Near the shore clumps of particles were floating.  These are dark green in color and when touched they quickly break apart.  They are like a mat of greenish brown organic material. These clumps began to appear periodically since the high water event in 2018.  They are only visible in the calm areas or bays when there is no wind.  They have been observed more frequently this summer- especially since this summer has had many days with little or no wind along our shoreline.
08/14/2019,Lake is almost calm.  There has been limited wind for the last few days
06/21/2020,Sunny day with some wind
