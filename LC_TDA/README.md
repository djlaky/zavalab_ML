# Extracting Information from Complex Optical Responses of Chemoresponsive Liquid Crystals Using Topological Descriptors

## âœ¨ Introduction
Chemoresponsive liquid crystals (LCs) can be engineered to generate information-rich optical responses (in the form of space-time color and brightness patterns) when exposed to target gas contaminants. We investigate the use of topological descriptors (Euler characteristic, lacunarity, and fractal dimension) for extracting information from these complex optical responses and show that this can enable the design of sensors and help gain insights into physical phenomena governing such responses. We provide a unifying perspective of topological descriptors via the theory of Minkowski functionals, which allows us to understand specific feature information that each descriptor extracts. We also show how to use the descriptors in conjunction with filtration operations and color representations to enrich the information extracted. We demonstrate our approach by using experimental data for chemoresponsive LC films that are exposed to different gaseous environments. Our analysis reveals that the descriptors encode significant information that can be used to predict contaminant concentrations using simple statistical models; these models achieve comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks but at a much lower computational cost and with enhanced interpretability. We focus our analysis on the Euler characteristic, which reveals that LC response patterns behave as Gaussian random fields; this allows us to determine characteristic length scales and establish correlations with key design parameters.
