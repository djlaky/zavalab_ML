    "# A Data Science Framework for the Analysis of Ion Transport Mechanisms in Ionic Liquids\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We analyze the underlying principles of pure ionic liquid conductivity and other properties using a dataset of 3D descriptors and data science framework. We combine molecular connectivity graphs, RDKit singe-ion simulations, PubChem3D data, and bulk properties to produce a dataset of easily accesibly for ionic liquids\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we propose a **solvent GNN (SolvGNN)** architecture that captures molecular interactions in an explicit manner by combining *atomic-level (local)* graph convolution and *molecular-level (global)* message passing through a molecular interaction network. SolvGNN uses a graph representation wherein each node represents a molecule and each edge represents a potential intermolecular interaction (e.g., hydrogen bonding). We tested SolvGNN via a case study on **activity coefficient predictions for binary and ternary mixtures** using large data sets obtained from **COnductor-like Screening MOdel for Real Solvation (COSMO-RS)** calculations. We show that the proposed SolvGNN can predict composition-dependent activity coefficients with high accuracy. To interpret the trained model, we performed **counterfactual analysis** on SolvGNN to highlight the physical implications of chemical structures and compositions on the solvation behavior. Finally, we built a SolvGNN-based framework that takes a given mixture (binary or ternary) as input and generates the corresponding **phase diagrams (P-x-y)** using predicted activity coefficients coupled with phase equilibrium calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "SolvGNN is an open-source **computational framework and tool**. It can be directly used as tools to predict activity coefficients and/or generate phase diagrams; it can also be used for researchers and developers to train their own data sets and initiate future research.\n",
